<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>So far as the Compiler is aware, no good collection of American
wit and humour exists on this side of the Atlantic; certainly, no
collection worthy to be considered as the American Joe Miller. In the
well-known "Percy Anecdotes," in the numerous English Joe Millers,
and other jest-books, a few of Brother Jonathan's good things are to
be found, in company with the rich and genial wit of John Bull, the
pawky humour of the Scotch, and the exuberant mirth of Paddy; but it
is believed that the present is the first attempt to present anything
like a complete collection of American witticisms to English readers.
While every justice has been done in this matter to Scotland by Dean
Ramsay's inimitable "Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character;"
and while a kindred service has been performed for England by Mr.
John Timbs, and still more recently by Mr. Mark Lemon, not to mention
others, no one, seemingly, has bethought him of gathering together the
happy scintillations of Brother Jonathan's intellect. The Compiler
trusts that he may have undertaken this task with at least some
success.</p>

<p>No one at all familiar with the periodical literature of America will
deny that the Americans are a witty people. Whether their native wit
be so intellectual and refined as the English, so quaint and subtle
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> the Scotch humour, or so strong and hearty as the Irish, or,
again, whether it be so keen and compact as the French <i>esprit</i>, may
be reasonably questioned; but that it is a straw that <i>can</i> tickle,
and therefore, according to Dryden, an instrument of happiness,
all must admit. In considering the nature of American humour, it
is obvious that broad exaggeration is its great characteristic. It
is essentially <i>outr&eacute;</i>. No people seek to raise the laugh by such
extravagant means as the Yankees. Their ordinary speech is hyperbole,
or tall talk. They never go out shooting unless with the long bow.
Again, their humour comes from without, rather than from within,
and is less a matter of thought than of verbal expression. It deals
with the association of ideas rather than with ideas themselves.
Transatlantic wit is not as a rule terse, epigrammatic, pungent,
like the wit of Lamb, Hood, or Jerrold, which often lies in a single
sentence or even word. The humour of Sam Slick or James Russell
Lowell, for instance, lies as much in accessories as in the thing
itself. It is nothing unless surrounded by circumstantial narrative.
But in this it must be confessed the Americans are great masters.
The humour of a people always reflects the character of that people,
and character, as we all know, is influenced in no small measure
by country and climate. Our American brethren are born, or as they
themselves say "raised," in a country whose physical features
have been planned on a scale far surpassing in magnitude&mdash;not
unfrequently in beauty also&mdash;those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> of every other country in the
world. The Americans feel this, and are justly proud of the extent
and magnificence of America. It leads them to compare it with other
countries, and the comparison is certain to result in favour of their
own. Theirs is the country of Lake Superior. Columbia is a Triton
among the minnows. Into this Brobdignag of our cousins Munchausen
emigrated early, and the genius of the celebrated German Baron still
continues to control its people. Only in America will you find a
man so tall that he is obliged to go up a ladder in order to shave
himself, or so small that it requires two men and a boy to see him;
only in America do the railway trains travel so fast that the train
often reaches the station considerably in advance of the whistle;
only in America are the fogs so thick that they may be cut with a
"ham knife." It is only an American artist who can paint a snow-storm
so naturally that he catches cold by sitting near it with his coat
off; it is only in America that sportsmen are such dead shots that
the birds when they see the gun "come down," rather than abide the
consequences of remaining "up;" and it is only in America that every
man is "one of the most remarkable men in the country." It must be
said of American humour, that you can always, and at once, "see the
joke." Its meaning is never hidden, and it seldom, if ever, takes the
form of the <i>double entendre</i>. To borrow an idea from Elia, there is
no need to grope all over your neighbour's face to be sure that he
appreciates a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> genuine Yankee joke. The grins it causes are the very
broadest, and the laughter it evokes is the very loudest.</p>

<p>While the Compiler hopes that all his readers may find something to
laugh at in the wise saws of Sam Slick, the broad grins of Artemus
Ward and Joshua Billings, the marvellous (impossible?) feats of the
renowned Major Longbow, and the cute remarks of those notorious
personages, the Down Easter and the Western Editor, which he has
here collected, he also trusts that none of them may find anything
to regret. Care has been exercised to exclude everything of an
objectionable character from the collection.</p>

<p>Since his elevation to the presidential chair, Mr. Lincoln has
acquired the reputation of being a good story-teller, and a number
of the best things attributed to "honest old Abe" have been included
in the collection, which will also be found to contain many of the
humorous stories and incidents to which the present unhappy war has
given rise. "Honest good humour," says Washington Irving, one of
America's greatest sons, "is the oil and wine of a merry meeting." It
is the earnest wish of the Compiler that the following pages may serve
to convince every reader of the truth of the remark.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AJM" id="THE_AJM"><small>THE</small></a><br /><br />

AMERICAN JOE MILLER.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3><a id="EARLY_RISING_IN_CONNECTICUT_1"></a>EARLY RISING IN CONNECTICUT.&mdash;1.</h3>

<p>The editor of the <i>Eglantine</i> says that the girls in Connecticut, who
are remarkable for their industry, drink about a pint of yeast before
going to bed at night, to make them <i>rise</i> early in the morning.</p>


<h3><a id="SMALL_LOAVES_2"></a>SMALL LOAVES.&mdash;2.</h3>

<p>A half-famished fellow in the Southern States tells of a baker (whose
loaves had been growing "small by degrees, and beautifully less,")
who, when going his rounds to serve his customers, stopped at the door
of one and knocked, when the lady within exclaimed, "Who's there?" and
was answered, "The baker." "What do you want?" "To leave your bread."
"Well, you needn't make such a fuss about it; put it through the
keyhole."</p>


<h3><a id="ONLY_THE_ELEVENTH_3"></a>ONLY THE ELEVENTH.&mdash;3.</h3>

<p>At a christening, while a minister was making the certificate, he
forgot the date, and happened to say: "Let me see, this is the 30th."
"The thirtieth!" exclaimed the indignant mother; "indeed, but it's
only the eleventh!"</p>


<h3><a id="SHARP_SHOOTING_4"></a>SHARP SHOOTING.&mdash;4.</h3>

<p>The following dialogue on "sharp shooting" is reported to have taken
place between a Virginee and a Yankee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
picket:&mdash;"I say, can you
fellows shoot?" "Wall, I reckon we can some. Down in Mississippi we
can knock a bumble-bee off a thistle bow at three hundred yards."
"Oh, that ain't nothing to the way we seewt up in Varmount. I belonged
to a military company ther', with a hundred men in the company, and
we went out for practice every week. The capt'n draws us up in single
file, and sets a cider-barrel rolling down the hill, and each man
takes his shot at the bung-hole as it turns up. It is afterwards
examined, and if there is a shot that didn't go in the bung-hole the
number who missed it is expelled. I belonged to the company ten years,
and there ain't been nobody expelled yet."</p>


<h3><a id="FOUR_POINTS_OF_A_CASE_5"></a>FOUR POINTS OF A CASE.&mdash;5.</h3>

<p>An Eastern editor says that a man in New York got himself into trouble
by marrying two wives. A Western editor replies by assuring his
contemporary that a good many men in that section had done the same
thing by marrying one. A Northern editor retorts that quite a number
of his acquaintances found trouble enough by barely promising to
marry, without going any further. A Southern editor says that a friend
of his was bothered enough when simply found in company with another
man's wife.</p>


<h3><a id="ADVANTAGE_OF_BURNING_TWO_CANDLES_6"></a>ADVANTAGE OF BURNING TWO CANDLES.&mdash;6.</h3>

<p>A celebrated American judge had a very stingy wife. On one occasion
she received his friends in the drawing-room with a single candle. "Be
pleased, my dear," said his lordship, "to let us have a second candle
that we may see where the other stands."</p>


<h3><a id="A_4-TUNATE_YOUNG_MAN_7"></a>A 4-TUNATE YOUNG MAN.&mdash;7.</h3>

<p>There is a young man in the U. S. army, who was born July 4, at 4
o'clock, p.m., at No. 44, in a street in Boston, is the 4th child,
has 4 names, enlisted in the Newton company, which joined the 4th
battalion, 44th regiment, and on the 4th of August was appointed 4th
corporal, and is now gone to defend his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="ELBOW-ROOM_SCARCE_8"></a>ELBOW-ROOM SCARCE.&mdash;8.</h3>

<p>Elbow-room has been quite scarce in Nashville during the past week.
Such scrouging, gouging, turning in and turning out, has seldom
before been witnessed. Instance the following:&mdash;Traveller dismounts
at a tavern. "Hallo, landlord, can I get lodgings here to-night?"
Landlord: "No, sir; every room in the house is engaged." Traveller:
"Can't you give me a blanket and a bunch of shavings for a pillow in
your bar-room?" Landlord: "No, sir; there's not a square foot of space
unoccupied anywhere in the house." Traveller: "Then I'll thank you,
sir, to shove a pole out of your second-floor window, and I'll roost
on that."</p>


<h3><a id="A_COUPLE_OF_REASONS_TOO_MANY_9"></a>A COUPLE OF REASONS TOO MANY.&mdash;9.</h3>

<p>The <i>Providence Journal</i> is accountable for the following: A drafted
man in this State called upon one of our lawyers, and desired to have
papers prepared claiming exemption from the military service for the
several reasons which he named. 1. That he was the only son of a widow
depending upon him for support. 2. That his father was in such infirm
health as to be unable to get his own living; and 3, that he had two
brothers already in the service. All of which facts Patrick desired
then and there to verify by affidavit. The lawyer, who had travelled
in Illinois and learned the knack of introducing <i>apropos</i> anecdotes,
reminded the drafted man of a little story of the maple-sugar man in
Vermont who was sued for returning a borrowed sap-kettle in a damaged
condition, and pleaded in defence&mdash;first, that the kettle was sound
when he returned it; secondly, that it was cracked when he borrowed
it; and thirdly, that he never had the sap-kettle. Patrick grinned a
ghastly smile, such as sometimes illumines the countenance of a man
before the Board of Enrolment when the doctor blandly assures him that
he has not got the liver complaint or the kidney disease, and withdrew
his papers.</p>


<h3><a id="EGG_BROF_10"></a>EGG "BROF."&mdash;10.</h3>

<p>"Well, Sambo, how do you like your new place?" "Oh, very well, massa."
"What did you have for breakfast this morning?" "Why, you see, missus
biled three eggs for herself, and gib me de brof."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="TO_MAKE_SAUSAGES_11"></a>TO MAKE SAUSAGES.&mdash;11.</h3>

<p>The editor of the <i>Southbridge Journal</i> was set all aback the other
day, when he asked a farmer's wife how she made sausages, and received
for answer&mdash;"Take your in'ards, scrape 'em, scald, and stuff 'em."</p>


<h3><a id="PREACH_SMALL_12"></a>&quot;PREACH SMALL.&quot;&mdash;12.</h3>

<p>"Mother," said a little girl, seven years old, "I could not understand
our minister to-day, he said so many hard words; I wish he would
preach so that little girls could understand him. Won't he, mother?"
"Yes, I think so, if we ask him." Soon after her father saw her going
to the minister's. "Where are you going, Emma?" said he. "I am going
over to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s, to ask him to <i>preach small</i>."</p>


<h3><a id="HARD_LYING_13"></a>HARD LYING.&mdash;13.</h3>

<p>There lives in New Hampshire a man called Joe, a fellow noted for the
tough lies he can tell. A correspondent informs us that Joe called in
at Holton's lately, and found him almost choked with smoke, when he
suggested, "You don't know as much about managing smoky chimneys as
I do, squire, or you'd cure 'em." "Ah!" said Holton, with interest,
"did you ever see a smoky chimney cured?" "Seen it?" said old Joe, "I
think I have. I had the worst one in Seaboard county once, and I cured
it a little too much." "How was that?" asked Holton. "Why, you see,"
said Joe, "I built a little house out yonder, at Wolf Hollow, ten or
twelve years ago. Jim Bush, the fellow that built the chimneys, kept
blind drunk three-quarters of the time, and crazy drunk the other.
I told him I thought he'd have something wrong; but he stuck to it
and finished the house. Well, we moved in, and built a fire the next
morning to boil the tea-kettle. All the smoke came through the room
and went out of the windows; not a bit went up the flues. We tried it
for two or three days, and it got worse and worse. By and by it came
on to rain, and the rain began to come down the chimney. It put the
fire out in a minute, and directly it came down by the pailful. We
had to get the baby off the floor as soon as we could, or it would
have been drowned. In fifteen minutes the water stood knee-deep
on the floor. I pretty soon saw what was the matter. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> drunken
cuss had put the chimney wrong end up, and it drawed downwards. It
gathered all the rain within a hundred yards, and poured it down by
bucketfuls." "Well, that was unfortunate," remarked Holton, "but what
in the world did you do with the house? Surely you never cured that
chimney?" "Didn't I, though?" answered old Joe; "yes, I did." "How?"
asked Holton. "Turned it the other end up," said the incorrigible,
"and then you ought to have seen it draw. That was the way I cured it
too much." "Drew too much?" asked Holton. "Well, squire, you may judge
for yourself," said old Joe. "Pretty soon after we got the chimney
down the other end up, I missed one of the chairs out of the room,
and directly I see'd another of 'em shooting towards the fireplace.
Next the table went, and I see the back log going up. Then I grabbed
the old woman under one arm and the baby under t'other and started;
but just as I got to the door I see'd the cat going across the floor
backwards, holding on with her claws to the carpet, yelling awfully.
It wasn't no use. I just see her going over the top of the chimney,
and that was the last of her." "Well, what did you do then?" asked
Holton; "of course you could not live in such a house?" "Couldn't I,
though?" said Joe; "but I did; I put a poultice on the jamb of the
fireplace, and that drawed t'other way, so we had no more trouble."
This is what we call hard lying.</p>


<h3><a id="BUSINESS_AND_AFFLICTION_14"></a>BUSINESS AND AFFLICTION.&mdash;14.</h3>

<p>Curious combinations are oftentimes found in the advertising columns
of newspapers. The following is the announcement made by a lately
bereaved wife:&mdash;"Died, on the 11th inst., at his shop, No. 20,
Greenwich Street, Mr. Edward Jones, much respected by all who knew
and dealt with him. As a man he was amiable; as a hatter, upright and
moderate. His virtues were beyond all price, and his beaver hats were
only three dollars each. He has left a widow to deplore his loss,
and a large stock to be sold cheap for the benefit of his family. He
was snatched to the other world in the prime of life, just as he had
concluded an extensive purchase of felt, which he got so cheap that
his widow can supply hats at more reasonable rates than any house
in the city. His disconsolate family will carry on business with
punctuality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="THE_JUDGMENT_OF_SOLOMON_15"></a>THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.&mdash;15.</h3>

<p>In the Justice's Court in New Orleans the judge was in a quandary
the other day. A coat was in dispute; the parties were Irish, and
the evidence was direct and positive for both claimants. After much
wrangling, Patrick Power, one of the parties, proposed that he and
his opponent, Timothy Maguire, should see whose name was on the
coat. Timothy searched in vain, and the coat was handed to Pat, who
immediately took his knife, opened a corner of the coat, and out
dropped two small peas. "There, d'ye see that, now!" "Yes; but what of
that?" said Timothy. "A dale it has to do wid it; it is my name to be
sure&mdash;pea for Patrick, and pea for Power, be jabers!" He got the coat,
he did.</p>


<h3><a id="YOUNG_JEFFS_APPETITE_16"></a>YOUNG JEFF.'S APPETITE.&mdash;16.</h3>

<p>When young Jeff. first came up to town, his father told him that it
would be polite, when being helped at dinner, to say to the host,
"Half that, if you please." It so happened that at the first dinner to
which he was invited a sucking-pig was one of the dishes. The host,
pointing with his knife to the young porker, asked, "Well, Mr. Jeff.,
will you have this, our favourite dish, or haunch of mutton?" Upon
which, recollecting his first lesson, he replied, "Half that, if you
please," to the consternation of all present.</p>


<h3><a id="MY_PEW_SIR_17"></a>MY PEW, SIR!&mdash;17.</h3>

<p>While the Convention which nominated General Taylor was in session
at Philadelphia, a somewhat noted local politician from Pickaway
county, Ohio, was in the city mingling in the muss. As the Convention
adjourned over Sunday, he concluded to go to church. "I mounted my
best regalia," he says, "and looked fine; stopped at the door, and
asked the sexton for a seat; was shown a very good one, entirely
unoccupied, in the back part of which I seated myself. In a very short
time a decent-looking man, plainly dressed, entered and took the front
of the pew. I held my head reverently, and looked pious. He glanced
at me several times, then took out a white handkerchief; looked at me
again, then took out a card, drew his pencil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> wrote 'This is my pew,
sir,' and tossed the card to me. I picked it up, and immediately wrote
on it, 'It is a very good one; what rent do you pay?' and tossed it
back."</p>


<h3><a id="MAKING_A_MANS_COFFIN_BEFORE_HIS_DEATH_18"></a>MAKING A MAN'S COFFIN BEFORE HIS DEATH.&mdash;18.</h3>

<p>An amusing thing occurred in the 24th Ohio. A few days since, a
soldier, passing to the lower part of the encampment, saw two others
from his company making a rude coffin. He inquired who it was for.
"John Bunce," said the others. "Why," replied he, "John is not dead
yet. It is too bad to make a man's coffin when you don't know if
he's going to die or not." "Don't you trouble yourself," replied the
others; "Dr. Coe told us to make his coffin, <i>and I guess he knows
what he give him</i>."</p>


<h3><a id="DRAWING_THE_LONG_BOW_19"></a>DRAWING THE LONG BOW.&mdash;19.</h3>

<p>A fellow was kicked out of an editorial room the other day for
impudently stating "that he had seen in Germany a fiddle so large that
it required two horses to draw the bow across the strings, which would
continue to sound six weeks!"</p>


<h3><a id="A_QUEER_CUP_OF_COFFEE_20"></a>A QUEER CUP OF COFFEE.&mdash;20.</h3>

<p>I soon had an opportunity to judge for myself, having accepted an
officer's invitation to take coffee in his tent. Captain H. was
very proud of his table. His cook was said to be the best in the
camp, his only fault being a disposition to a careless mixture of
ingredients. "There, sir," said the captain, handing me a brimming
cup, "I'll warrant you'll find that equal to anything you ever drank
in Paris." I tasted. The captain saw something was wrong. He tasted.
His countenance assumed a stern and mortified expression. John was
called and ordered to investigate the cause of the villanous taste
of the coffee. The next moment he reappeared, holding the coffee-pot
in his hand. "Och, be jabers, captain," said he, "it's meself that's
mortified to death. I cooked the bowl of me ould pipe in your
coffee this morning, and that's the innocent cause of the bad taste
intirely!"</p>

<h3><a id="REMARKABLE_TENACITY_OF_LIFE_22"></a>REMARKABLE TENACITY OF LIFE.&mdash;22.</h3>

<p>A few evenings since, in the "private crib" of one of our exchanges,
there was a learned dissertation, subject, "Bed-bugs, and their
Remarkable Tenacity of Life." One asserted of his own knowledge that
they could be boiled, and then come to life. Some had soaked them for
hours in turpentine without any fatal consequences. Old Hanks, who
had been listening as an outsider, here gave in his experience in
corroboration of the facts. Says he, "Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> years ago I took a bed-bug
to an iron-foundry, and dropping it into a ladle where the melted iron
was, had it run into a skillet. Well, my old woman used that skillet
pretty constant for the last six years, and here the other day it
broke all to smash; and what do you think, gentlemen, that 'ere insect
just walked out of his hole, where he'd been layin' like a frog in a
rock, and made tracks for his old roost upstairs! But," added he, by
way of parenthesis, "he looked mighty pale."</p>


<h3><a id="SAMS_SOUL_23"></a>SAM'S SOUL.&mdash;23.</h3>

<p>"Sam," said an interesting young mother to her youngest hopeful, "do
you know what the difference is between the body and soul? The soul,
my child, is what you love with; the body carries you about. This is
your body," touching the little fellow's shoulders and arms, "but
there is something deeper in&mdash;you can feel it now; what is that?" "Oh,
I know," said Sam, with a flash of intelligence in his eyes, "that's
my flannel shirt!"</p>


<h3><a id="AMERICAN_ESTIMATE_OF_THEIR_CLERGY_24"></a>AMERICAN ESTIMATE OF THEIR CLERGY.&mdash;24.</h3>

<p>The <i>Louisville Journal</i> assures an inquiring spinster that gospel
ministers are not more addicted to dissipation than men of other
professions. A few of the Kalloch type take gin-toddies and liberties
with females, but the majority of them are as good as lawyers. If you
want a true Christian, marry an editor.</p>


<h3><a id="WHERE_WARREN_FELL_25"></a>&quot;WHERE WARREN FELL.&quot;&mdash;25.</h3>

<p>A Yankee gentleman, escorting a British friend around to view the
different objects of attraction in the vicinity of Boston, brought him
to Bunker's Hill. They stood looking at the splendid shaft, when the
Yankee said, "This is the place where Warren fell." "Ah!" replied the
Englishman evidently not posted up in local historical matters, "did
it hurt him much?" The native looked at him, with the expression of
fourteen Fourths of Julys in his countenance&mdash;"Hurt him!" said he, "he
was killed, sir." "Ah! he was, eh?" said the stranger, still eyeing
the monument, and computing its height in his own mind, layer by
layer; "well, I should think he would have been, to fall so far."</p>

<h3><a id="OUT-YANKEED_26"></a>OUT-YANKEED.&mdash;26.</h3>

<p>After the battle of Fredericksburg a little Yankee officer was talking
with one of our Alabama majors, who stood in that part of the field
where we had suffered most severely&mdash;dead men and horses, broken
cannon, and blown-up caissons being all around him. "You hurt us
powerful bad yesterday," said the Yankee. "Yes," replied the major,
drily. "Guess we hurt you some, too," rejoined the Yankee, looking at
the wrecks of humanity strewn about. "Didn't kill a man or a horse,"
said the major. The little Yankee looked up at the tall Confederate
for a moment, then at the dead men and horses on every side, and then
wheeled suddenly round and walked rapidly away, utterly astounded at
the cool manner in which the Alabamian had out-Yankeed the Yankees in
deliberate lying.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_PRESIDENTS_VOICE_27"></a>THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE.&mdash;27.</h3>

<p>We got one darkie on the way out. He had never seen a cannon, and of
course did not know what it was. He stood beside one when they fired
it off, and I assure you Parry the clown never dropped as quick as he
did. His eyes rolled wildly, and he alarmingly called out: "Oh Lord!
hab mercy on dis poor chile. He am for de Union ebery time, sah." The
artillerymen might have been tied with straws. When they had got over
their laugh, they told him it was one of old Abe's guns. The nigger
said, "He hab a bery loud voice."</p>


<h3><a id="HOW_A_COPPERHEAD_WAS_SHAVED_28"></a>HOW A "COPPERHEAD" WAS SHAVED.&mdash;28.</h3>

<p>One day, lately, a well-known gentleman in Philadelphia stepped
into a barber's shop, sat in a shaving-chair, drew a newspaper from
his pocket, and instructed the knight of the razor to take off his
beard. The barber was an African. He simply replied, "Yes, boss," and
produced his implements. The customer sat down. He was duly shaved.
His face was wiped; he arose, and donned his coat and hat. "How much?"
he asked, in a dolorous voice, as he adjusted his shirt-collar.
"Fifteen cents, boss." "Why, I thought you shaved for ten cents at
this shop." "Dat ar's de average, sah," was the reply. "Ten cents is
de price of a shave in dis yer shop. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> come in here, sah, and read
the news of Sheridan's victory, and your face got about six inches
longer dan when yer come in. If your face was like it was afore you
read dat yar news ten cents was the price. When you commenced to read
about de defeat of Early, den your face stretched down about four
inches. Dat's what makes it wurf fifteen cents for der shave." The
customer couldn't restrain a grin, though he was a Copperhead, and the
hit at him was made by a "nigger." He paid the fee, and walked out. He
was one of those gentlemen who go their length upon M'Clellan, and who
of course shudder at every victory to the Union arms.</p>


<h3><a id="WHAT_HE_DID_THE_FIRST_YEAR_29"></a>WHAT HE DID THE FIRST YEAR.&mdash;29.</h3>

<p>In one of the courts at Hartford, Connecticut, recently, a woman
was testifying on behalf of her son, and swore that he had worked
on a farm ever since he was born. The lawyer who cross-examined her
said, "You assert that your son has worked on a farm ever since he
was born?" "I do." "What did he do the first year?" "He milked,"
she replied. The whole court laughed heartily, and the witness was
questioned no further.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_LEARNED_MEMBERS_OF_THE_AMERICAN_LEGISLATURE_30"></a>THE LEARNED MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGISLATURE.&mdash;30.</h3>

<p>A good story is told of the landlord of a hotel at Holly Springs,
Miss. It was a large fashionable hotel, and the landlord was a pompous
man, with a large corporosity and a ruffled shirt-bosom. Printed bills
of fare were provided, yet the landlord stood at the head of the table
at dinner and, in a loud voice, read off the list of articles in a
rhyming way&mdash;"Here's boiled ham, and raspberry jam; baked potatoes and
cooked tomatoes; turnips smashed and squashes <i>squashed</i>;" and so on.
Mr. M. asked him afterward why he read it aloud when printed copies
were on the table. "Force of habit," replied the landlord; "got so
used to it I can't help it. You see, I commenced business down here in
Jackson (the capital of Mississippi), and most of all the Legislature
boarded with me. There wasn't a man of 'em could read, so I had to
read the bill of fare to 'em."</p>

<h3><a id="A_CANDID_PARSON_31"></a>A CANDID PARSON.&mdash;31.</h3>

<p>A Yankee divine, of an advanced age, married for his second wife a
damsel young and handsome. When the elders of the church went to
inquire if the lady was a suitable person to make a useful figure as
a parson's wife, he answered frankly that he didn't think she was.
"But," added the irrepressible doctor, "although I don't pretend she
is a saint, she is a very pretty little sinner, and I love her." The
twain became one flesh.</p>


<h3><a id="A_STUMP_ORATOR_32"></a>A STUMP ORATOR.&mdash;32.</h3>

<p>An Ohio stumper, while making a speech, paused in the midst of it and
exclaimed, "Now, gentlemen, what do you think?" Instantly a man rose
in the assembly, and, with one eye partially closed, modestly replied,
"I think, sir&mdash;I do indeed, sir&mdash;I think if you and I were to stump
the country together we would tell more lies than any other two men in
the country, sir; and I'd not say a word during the whole time, sir."</p>


<h3><a id="THE_COLONEL_ANSWERED_33"></a>THE COLONEL ANSWERED.&mdash;33.</h3>

<p>A certain colonel, a staff officer of one of the northern generals,
noted for his talent for repartee and the favourable opinion which he
entertained of his own good looks, stopped at the house of a farmer,
and discovered there a fine milch cow, and, still better, a pretty
girl, attired in a neat calico dress cut low in the neck and short in
the sleeves. After several unsuccessful attempts to engage the young
lady in conversation, he proposed to her to have the cow milked for
his own special benefit. This she indignantly refused. The colonel
not wishing to compromise his reputation for gallantry, remarked that
if all the young ladies in Virginia were as beautiful as the one
he had the pleasure of addressing, he had no desire to conquer the
Confederacy. With a toss of her pretty head, and a slight elevation of
her nose, she answered thus: "Well, sir, if all the gentlemen in your
army are as ugly as you are we ladies have no desire to conquer them."
How are you, colonel?</p>

<h3><a id="PITHY_LETTER_34"></a>PITHY LETTER.&mdash;34.</h3>

<p>General Rosecrans a few days ago received the following pertinent
letter from an indignant private:&mdash;"General,&mdash;I have been in the
service eighteen months, and have never received a cent. I desire
a furlough for fifteen days, in order to return home and remove my
family to the poor-house." The general granted the furlough.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_GRAHAM_SYSTEM_35"></a>THE GRAHAM SYSTEM.&mdash;35.</h3>

<p>A little prattler, who had been brought up on the Graham system, asked
what she should have to eat when she went to Heaven. "The bread of
life, my dear," was the reply. "Will there be any butter on it, ma?"
was the quick retort.</p>


<h3><a id="WARD_BEECHERS_PREACHING_36"></a>WARD BEECHER'S PREACHING.&mdash;36.</h3>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher asked Park Benjamin, the poet and humorist, why

"Why, Beecher, the fact is, I have conscientious scruples against
going to places of public amusement on Sunday."</p>


<h3><a id="KISSING_IN_WISCONSIN_37"></a>KISSING IN WISCONSIN.&mdash;37.</h3>

<p>A Milwaukee paper says that when a Wisconsin girl is kissed, she
looks surprised, and says, "How could you do it?" To which the swain
replies, "It will give me much pleasure to show you," and proceeds to
give her a duplicate.</p>


<h3><a id="TOO_SLOW_FOR_PARADISE_38"></a>TOO SLOW FOR PARADISE.&mdash;38.</h3>

<p>Pickering is a very nervous little man, who fusses and fidgets about
in a remarkably quick manner, and who holds in detestation anything
that can possibly come under the head of a slow coach, and indulges in
rather queer expressions when anything moves too slow for his views.
He is blessed with a "maid-of-all-work," who has caused him to utter
more profane words during the past three months than three years in
purgatory can atone for. One evening last week he despatched the girl
upon an errand to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> neighbouring store, and according to his ideas
she remained an unaccountably long time. He pulled out his watch and
looked half-a-dozen times within ten minutes, whistled, drummed upon
the table with his fingers, beat time with his feet upon the floor,
and finally started up again and began pacing the room, as if his
nervous agitation could in any degree accelerate the movements of the
absent abigail. But the girl came at length, and her impatient master
broke forth with&mdash;"For goodness' sake, Maggie, where have you been?"
"In the store, sir," was Maggie's reply. "Well," said her master, "it
is about one hundred yards to the store, and you have been fifteen
minutes in going and returning." "Yes, sir," broke in the girl. "Now,
Maggie," continued he, "take my advice, and when you die, remain
quietly in your grave, and never make an attempt to get to Heaven."
"And why not, sir?" queried the bewildered girl. "Because," said
Pickering, "the sun is ninety-six millions of miles from the earth,
and Heaven is beyond that; and if you ever make an attempt to get
there, at the rate you move, eternity will come to an end before you
reach your destination."</p>


<h3><a id="THATS_A_GOOD_UN_39"></a>THAT'S A GOOD 'UN!&mdash;39.</h3>

<p>Some one was telling Sam about the longevity of the mud turtle. "Yes,"
said Sam, "I know all about that, for once I found a venerable old
fellow in a meadow, who was so old that he could scarcely wiggle his
tail, and on his back was carved (tolerably plain, considering all
things) these words: 'Paradise, Year 1, Adam.'"</p>


<h3><a id="INTERESTING_TO_THE_PARTIES_CONCERNED_40"></a>INTERESTING TO THE PARTIES CONCERNED.&mdash;40.</h3>

<p>In connexion with the late riot in that city the <i>Boston Journal</i>
publishes the following:&mdash;The individual who dropped half of his thumb
at the corner of Cooper and North Mangin Streets on Tuesday night,
may have some interest in knowing that it has been picked up and
carefully preserved by a worthy citizen of Ward 5; and the individual
in his shirt sleeves who limped off with a bullet in his hip from a
spot near the same neighbourhood, on the same night, may receive the
brick he gave in exchange for it by returning the bullet to the 3rd
police-station.</p>

<h3><a id="A_KNOWING_JURYMAN_41"></a>A KNOWING JURYMAN.&mdash;41.</h3>

<p>A New Jersey paper tells a story of a well-known character who
frequently figured on juries in New York. While on a jury, as soon
as they had retired to their room to deliberate, he would button up
his coat and "turn in" on a bench, exclaiming: "Gentlemen, I'm for
bringing in a verdict for plaintiff (or defendant, as he had settled
his mind), and all creation can't move me. Therefore, as soon as you
have all agreed with me, wake me up, and we'll go in."</p>


<h3><a id="PAY_YOUR_POSTAGE_42"></a>PAY YOUR POSTAGE.&mdash;42.</h3>

<p>An American paper commends the following terrible lines to some of its
correspondents who have forgotten to prepay their letters, and saddled
the editor with sundry twopences to save their penny. The wild beauty
of the lines bespeaks the editor to have been in a mesmeric <i>coma</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"The man who now-a-days will write,<br /></span>

<h3><a id="SOUND_ADVICE_43"></a>SOUND ADVICE.&mdash;43.</h3>

<p>The private secretary of a cabinet minister is a wag. The other day
a young man, decidedly inebriated, walked into the executive chamber
and asked for the governor. "What do you want with him?" inquired the
secretary. "Oh, I want an office with a good salary&mdash;a sinecure."
"Well," replied the secretary, "I can tell you something better for
you than a sinecure&mdash;you had better try a water cure." A new idea
seemed to strike the young inebriate, and he vanished.</p>


<h3><a id="SIMPLICITY_44"></a>SIMPLICITY.&mdash;44.</h3>

<p>An exchange tells the following simple story of a little child
kneeling by his bed to pray, as he retired for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> night. He said:
"Dear Heavenly Father, please don't let the large cow hook me, nor
the horse kick me; and don't let me run away outside of the gate when
mother tells me not to."</p>


<h3><a id="CORKING_UP_DAYLIGHT_45"></a>CORKING UP DAYLIGHT.&mdash;45.</h3>

<p>It is reported that a Yankee down East has invented a machine for
corking up daylight, which will eventually supersede gas. He covers
the interior of a flour barrel with shoemaker's wax, holds it open to
the sun, then suddenly heads up the barrel. The light sticks to the
wax, and at night can be cut into lots to suit purchasers.</p>


<h3><a id="A_BABY_STORY_46"></a>A BABY STORY.&mdash;46.</h3>

<p>A very curious baby story comes to us from New Jersey. A mother and a
daughter were confined on the same day, each having a little son. In
the bustle of the moment, both babies were placed in the same cradle,
and, to the confusion of the mothers, when the youngsters were taken
from the cradle, they were unable to tell which was the mother's and
which was the daughter's son&mdash;a matter which, of course, must ever
remain a mystery. The family is in the greatest distress over the
affair.</p>


<h3><a id="MARRIAGE_NOTICES_47"></a>MARRIAGE NOTICES.&mdash;47.</h3>

<p>A Western paper gives the following notice:&mdash;All notices of marriage,
where no bride-cake is sent, will be set up in small type, and poked
into some outlandish corner of the papers. Where a handsome piece of
cake is sent, it will be put conspicuously in large letters; when
gloves, or other bride favours are added, a piece of illustrative
poetry will be given in addition. When, however, the editor attends
the ceremony in <i>propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>, and kisses the bride, it will have
especial notice&mdash;very large type, and the most appropriate poetry that
can be begged, borrowed, stolen, or coined from the brain editorial.</p>


<h3><a id="A_HOMELY_FLAG_OF_TRUCE_48"></a>A HOMELY FLAG OF TRUCE.&mdash;48.</h3>

<p>A rebel at Gettysburg, wishing to surrender, and having nothing
else for a flag of truce, dived his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> into his pantaloons, and
elevated his shirt above his head, amid roars of laughter from the
Federals, who immediately accepted his unconditional surrender. Rather
a good thing for that rebel that he was the possessor of such a luxury
as a reasonably clean shirt.</p>


<h3><a id="HE_HAD_HIM_THAT_TIME_49"></a>HE HAD HIM THAT TIME.&mdash;49.</h3>

<p>A candidate for office, wishing to describe his opponent as a
"soulless man," said: "Some persons hold the opinion that just at
the precise moment after one human being dies, another is born,
and the soul enters and animates the new-born babe. Now, I have
made particular inquiries concerning my opponent, and I find that
for some hours before he drew breath nothing but a donkey died.
Fellow-citizens, I will now leave you to draw the inference."</p>


<h3><a id="DE_DISSOLUTION_OF_COPARSNIPS_50"></a>&quot;DE DISSOLUTION OF COPARSNIPS.&quot;&mdash;50.</h3>

<p>A coloured firm in Newark, New Jersey, having suffered some pecuniary
embarrassments, recently closed business, and the senior member gave
to the public the following "notis:"&mdash;"De dissolution of coparsnips

<h3><a id="UNACCEPTABLE_GRATITUDE_51"></a>UNACCEPTABLE GRATITUDE.&mdash;51.</h3>

<p>Lieutenant J&mdash;&mdash;n, late of the 16th regiment, was, a few days ago,
walking down Main Street, Utica, when he was accosted by a fellow,
half soldier, half beggar, with a most reverential military salute.
"God bless your honour," said the man, whose accent betrayed him to
be Irish, "and long life to you." "How do you know me?" said the
lieutenant. "Is it how do I know your honour?" responded Pat. "Good
right, sure, I have to know the man who saved my life in battle." The
lieutenant, highly gratified at this tribute to his valour, slid a
fifty cent bill into his hand, and asked him when. "God bless your
honour, and long life to you," said the grateful veteran. "Sure it was
at Antietam, when, seeing your honour run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> away as fast as your legs
could carry you from the rebels I followed your lead, and ran after
you out of the way whereby, under God, I saved my life. Oh! good luck
to your honour; I never will forget it to you."</p>


<h3><a id="FEELING_HER_WAY_52"></a>FEELING HER WAY.&mdash;52.</h3>

<p>General Schenck, discussing the Democratic platform, in a speech
at Hamilton, Ohio, brought down the House by the following
illustration:&mdash;"I know nothing at all that is like it, unless it may
be the character of the fruit that is sold by an old lady who sits at
the door of the court-house in Cincinnati. She is a shrewd old woman.
A young sprig of a lawyer stepped up one day and said to her, 'You
seem to have some fine apples; are they sweet or sour?' The old lady
tried to take the measure of her customer, and find out whether his
taste was for sweet or sour apples. 'Why, sir,' said she, 'they are
rather acid; a sort of low tart, inclined to be very sweet.'"</p>


<h3><a id="FORENSIC_ELOQUENCE_53"></a>FORENSIC ELOQUENCE.&mdash;53.</h3>

<p>The following is as an extract from the recent address of a barrister
"out West" to a jury:&mdash;"The law expressly declares, gentlemen, in the
beautiful language of Shakspeare, that where no doubt exists of the
prisoner, it is your duty to fetch him in innocent. If you keep this
fact in view, in the case of my client, gentlemen, you will have the
honour of making a friend of him and all his relations, and you can
allers look upon this occasion and reflect with pleasure that you have
done as you would be done by. But if, on the other hand, you disregard
the principle of law, and set at naught my eloquent remarks and fetch
him in guilty, the silent twitches of conscience will follow you all
over every fair cornfield, I reckon, and my injured and down-trodden
client will be apt to light on you one of these dark nights, <i>as my
cat lights on a sasserful of new milk</i>."</p>


<h3><a id="STORY_WITH_A_MORAL_54"></a>STORY WITH A MORAL.&mdash;54.</h3>

<p>A young Yankee had formed an attachment for the daughter of a rich
old farmer, and after agreeing with the "bonnie lassie" went to the
old farmer to ask his consent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> and during the ceremony, which was an
awkward one with Jonathan, he whittled away at a stick. The old man
watched the movements of the knife, at the same time continuing to
talk on the prospects of his future son-in-law, as he supposed, until
the stick was dwindled down to naught. He then spoke as follows:&mdash;"You
have fine property, you have steady habits; good enough looking; but
you can't have my daughter. Had you made something, no matter what,
of the stick you whittled away, you could have had her; as it is you
cannot. Your property will go as the stick did, little by little,
until all is gone, and your family reduced to want. I have read your
character; you have my answer."</p>

<p>Two bushwhackers were captured, both of whom were very properly dealt
with summarily by being hanged. One of them had received a shot in
the shoulder, inflicting a painful wound, disabling him from making
his escape. While the officer was arranging the hempen necklace about
the wounded tory's neck, it produced considerable pain in the wounded
shoulder, which induced him to exclaim&mdash;"Oh! do please don't! I don't
believe I can bear to be hung&mdash;my shoulder is so sore!"</p>


<h3><a id="AN_AGREEABLE_CUSTOMER_56"></a>AN AGREEABLE CUSTOMER.&mdash;56.</h3>

<p>"Stranger, I want to leave my dog in this 'ere office till the boat
starts; I'm afraid somebody will steal him." "You can't do it," said
the clerk; "take him out." "Well, stranger, that is cruel; but you're
both dispositioned alike, and he's kinder company for you." "Take him
out!" roared the clerk. "Well, stranger, I don't think you're honest,
and you want watching. Here, Dragon," he said to the dog, "sit down
here, and watch that fellow sharp!" and turning on his heel said: "Put
him out, stranger, if he's troublesome." The dog lay there till the
boat started, watching and howling at every movement of the clerk, who
gave him the better half of the office.</p>


<h3><a id="FAILED_FOR_A_GOOD_REASON_57"></a>FAILED FOR A GOOD REASON.&mdash;57.</h3>

<p>Many a glorious speculation has failed for the same good reason that
the old Taxan ranger gave when he was asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> why he didn't buy land
when it was dog cheap. "Wall, I did come nigh onto taking eight
thousand acres once't," said old Joe, mournfully. "You see, two of
the boys came in one day from an Indian hunt without any shoes, and
offered me their titles to two leagues just below for a pair of
boots." "For a pair of boots!" we exclaimed. "But why on earth did you
not take it? They'd be worth a hundred thousand dollars to-day. Why
did'nt you give them the boots?" "Just because I did'nt have the boots
to give," said old Joe, as he took another chew of tobacco, quite as
contented as if he owned two hundred leagues of land.</p>

<p>"Massa," said the black steward to his captain, as they fell in with
a homeward-bound vessel, "I wish you would write a few lines for me
to the old woman, 'cause I can't write." The good-natured skipper
complied, and wrote all that Pompey dictated. As the captain was about
to seal up the letter, Pompey reminded him that he had omitted to say,
"Please 'scuse de bad writin' and spellin'."</p>


<h3><a id="IM_THE_BAGGAGE_59"></a>&quot;I'M THE BAGGAGE.&quot;&mdash;59.</h3>

<p>As the mid-day Worcester train was about leaving the <i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t</i>, a man of
the Johnsonian type of manners entered one of the cars, and gruffly
requested that two young ladies occupying separate seats should sit
together, that he and his friend might enjoy a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> on the
other seat. "But," said one of the damsels, blushing, "this seat
is engaged." "Engaged, is it?" brusquely responded the man; "who
engaged it!" "A young man," said the conscious maiden. "A young man,
eh! where's his baggage?" persisted Ursa Major. "I'm his baggage,
Old Hateful," replied the demure damsel, putting her rosy lips into
the prettiest pout. "Old Hateful" subsided; the young man came
in, extended his arm protectingly, almost caressingly, around his
"baggage," and Mr. Conductor Capron started the train.</p>


<h3><a id="CROSS_PURPOSES_60"></a>CROSS PURPOSES.&mdash;60.</h3>

<p>A colporteur recently entered a log-house of a dweller in Ohio, and
asked the mistress of the household if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> had the gospel there.
She said: "No; but they have it dreadful bad about four miles below."
This may have been the same colporteur who entered another log-house,
and inquired if there were any Presbyterians in that vicinity. He was
answered: "I guess not; my old man has not killed any since we have
lived here." In one instance the colporteur was taken for a doctor; in
the other for a hunter.</p>

<p>One day a wealthy old lady, whose plantation was in the vicinity of
the camp, came in and inquired for General Payne. When the commander
made his appearance, the old lady, in warm language, at once
acquainted him with the fact that his men had stolen her last coop
full of chickens, and demanded their restitution or their value in
currency. "I am sorry for you, madam," replied the general, "but I
can't help it. The fact is, madam, we are determined to squelch out
the rebellion, if it takes every chicken in Tennessee."</p>

<p>An officer in Banks's department recently received a letter from his
little daughter at home, asking him to send her money with which to
buy a new bonnet, to which he replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"I would send you a kiss, dear daughter,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But kisses thus sent in a letter<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But as I am 'hard up,' and you not in need,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You will have to put up with the will for the deed;<br /></span>

<p>A Western editor sums up the peculiarities of a contemporary as
follows:&mdash;He is too lazy to earn a meal, and too mean to enjoy one. He
was never generous but once, and that was when he gave the itch to an
apprentice boy&mdash;so much for his goodness of heart! Of his industry, he
says, the public may judge when he states that the only time he ever
worked was when he mistook castor oil for honey.</p>

<p>On the evening before the last unsuccessful attempt to storm the
defences of Port Hudson, some of our skirmishers were endeavouring,
under cover of darkness, to draw closer to the rebel works. A rebel
sentinel discovered them, and hallooed out: "How are you, Yank?" One
of our men replied: "Yes, we're bound to come." "All right," returned
the rebel, "we have got room enough to bury you."</p>

<p>Some young ladies who had been attending an evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> party, desired
to return home, but had no male attendant. The master of the house
requested his son to accompany them, and made use of a scripture name.
What was it? Jeroboam&mdash;Jerry beau 'em.</p>

<p>Jerry proving reluctant, the gentleman desired another son to act as
escort. What scripture name did he utter? Lemuel&mdash;Lem you will.</p>

<p>Still there was a difficulty, and a like request was made in a similar
manner to another son. What was it? Samuel&mdash;Sam you will.</p>

<p>Sam having consented, the parties took their seats in a sleigh, for
the purpose of going home. It was found there was plenty of room for
one more. What scripture name did the old gentleman use to induce
another son to accompany the guests? Benjamin&mdash;Ben jam in.</p>

<p>The driver was requested to start in another scripture name. What was
it? Joshua&mdash;Josh away.</p>

<p>When the sleigh was fairly off, it was discovered that one of the
young ladies had been left behind. There was no possibility of
recalling her companions, so the old gentleman asked still another of
his sons to console the young lady for her disappointment. What was
the last scripture name thus used? Ebenezer&mdash;Eben ease her.</p>


<h3><a id="AN_INQUIRING_MIND_69"></a>AN INQUIRING MIND.&mdash;69.</h3>

<p>Some people have very inquiring minds; but few, we think, carry their
curiosity so far as a Yankee friend of ours, who rang the bell of a
fashionable residence the other day, and when the servant girl made
her appearance, politely inquired, "What are you going to have for
dinner to-day?" The girl, thinking the man was one of their tradesmen,
and had made the inquiry in his business capacity, innocently replied,
"Mutton, sir." "Mutton&mdash;with sauce?" "Yes, sir." "Ah, well! I was
passing by, and thought I would inquire. Good morning." The servant
was indignant when she came to comprehend the man's motive, but he was
too far up the street to hear her angry denunciations.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickson, a coloured barber in a large New England town, was
shaving one of his customers, a respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> citizen, one morning,
when a conversation occurred between them respecting Mr. Dickson's
former connexion with a coloured church in that place. "I believe
you are connected with the church in Elm Street, are you not, Mr.
Dickson?" said the customer. "No, sah, not at all." "Why did you leave
your connexion, Mr. Dickson, if I maybe permitted to ask?" "Well, I'll
tell you, sah," said Mr. Dickson; "it was just like dis: I jined the
church in good fait; I gave ten dollars towards de stated gospel de
fus' year, and de church people call me <i>Brudder</i> Dickson; the second
year my business was not so good, and I gib only five dollars. Dat
year people call me <i>Mr.</i> Dickson. Dis razor hurt you, sah?" "No, the

politely waited until somebody opened it and let him in.</p>


<h3><a id="SCENE_IN_AN_AMERICAN_COURT_72"></a>SCENE IN AN AMERICAN COURT.&mdash;72.</h3>

<p>There was a hush in the police court-room as the red-nosed judge took
his seat upon the bench, and in a pompous tone of authority shouted,
"Bring the prisoner into court!" "Here I am, bound to blaze, as the
spirit of turpentine said when he was all a-fire," said the prisoner.
"We'll take a little fire out of you. How do you live?" asked the
judge. "I ain't particular, as the oyster said when they asked him
if he'd be roasted or fried." "We don't want to know what the oyster
said, or the spirits of turpentine either. What do you follow?"
"Anything that comes in my way, as the locomotive said when she ran
over a little nigger." "Don't care anything about the locomotive. What
is your business?" "That's various, as the cat said when she stole
the chicken off the table." "If I hear any more absurd comparisons,
I will give you twelve months." "I'm done, as the beefsteak said to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> cook." "Now, sir, your punishment shall depend on the shortness
and correctness of your answers. I suppose you live by going round
the docks." "No, sir; I can't go around the docks without a coat,
and I ain't got none." "Answer me, sir! How do you get your bread?"
"Sometimes at the baker's, and sometimes I eat taters." "No more of
your stupid nonsense. How do you support yourself?" "Sometimes on my
legs, and sometimes on a chair." "How do you keep yourself alive?" "By
breathing, sir." "I order you to answer this question correctly. How
do you do?" "Pretty well, I thank you, judge. How do you do?" "I shall
have to commit you." "Well, you've committed yourself first, that's
some consolation." The prisoner went out of court with a jerk, and was
hastened to gaol.</p>


<h3><a id="SOAP_COMING_HANDY_73"></a>SOAP COMING HANDY.&mdash;73.</h3>

<p>During one of the recent battles, while a regiment of our troops
was rapidly marching over a dusty road, in changing their position
on the field, a soldier noticed a cake of soap at a little distance
from the rank, and sprang forward to get it, saying, "I shall need
it after this fight." The shells of the enemy were falling thickly;
and just as the soldier seized the soap, one dropped close behind him
and exploded, tearing open an immense hole in the earth, and nearly
burying the poor fellow. Every one supposed he was blown to pieces,
but almost immediately he struggled out, begrimed with dirt from head
to foot, yet holding on to the soap, and exclaiming, "There, I told
you I should need it!" Fortunately, he passed through the battle
unhurt, and found his well-earned soap a great convenience.</p>

<h3><a id="A_DRY_JOKE_IN_A_DRY_GOODS_STORE_76"></a>A DRY JOKE IN A DRY GOODS' STORE.&mdash;76.</h3>

<p>An amusing incident recently took place in one of our dry goods'
stores down town. A good-looking, honest-faced country girl, came to
town with her lover, to do a trifle of shopping. The magnitude of the
store, the piles on piles of goods, the dazzling array of articles,
the rows of busy clerks, the flitting cash boys, quite overpowered
our good friend, who scarcely knew what to do. Her swain obstinately
refused to go in, but loitered about the door. The clerks being all
busy just at the moment, the young lady was obliged to remain standing
a few moments. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> length, a dapper fellow, with gold watch and chain
and flourishing moustache, came bowing and smiling up to the blushing
customer, with&mdash;"Anybody waiting on you, madam?" The colour deepened
in her cheeks, as she hesitated and drew a long breath; till, finally,
with a nod of her head towards the door, she faltered out, "Yes, sir;
he is."</p>

<p>After having witnessed the performance, from what I could make out of
the play I don't think Macbeth was a good moral character; and his
lady appeared to me to possess a tarnation dictatorial temper, and to
have exceedingly loose notions of hospitality, which, together with an
unpleasant habit of talking to herself and walking about <i>en chemise</i>,
must make her a decidedly unpleasant companion.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_PUGNACIOUS_RAM_78"></a>THE PUGNACIOUS RAM.&mdash;78.</h3>

<p>John B. Gough, in one of his eloquent temperance lectures, was
encouraging those who signed the pledge to stick to it. "Stick to
it," said he, "as the old ram did to his butting." The story is that
a farmer had a ram which would run his head against the cows, horses,
pigs, and, indeed, against everything in motion. The farmer himself
was more than once butted over, and he finally determined to break up
this propensity: so he tied a heavy block of wood upon a rope, and
hung it on the limb of a tree. The block was set in motion, and the
ram, seeing it move towards him, hit it a blow. This sent it off;
but it swung back, and the ram hit it again, and so kept on doing.
The farmer watched him until it was dark, and then left him (true to
his nature) butting away. Early in the morning, on going out to see
how the ram had fared, he found that he had butted himself all away,
except a part of his tail, and that was hammering away at the swinging
block. That's the way to stick to your pledge.</p>


<h3><a id="A_HORRIFIED_DANDY_79"></a>A HORRIFIED DANDY.&mdash;79.</h3>

<p>A dandy, who was seated on the balcony of a Saratoga hotel, among
a large company, was exquisitely dressed, and very highly perfumed
with musk, which is very disagreeable to some persons. A plain farmer
happening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> pass near him, commenced snuffing suspiciously, and,
looking around for the cause of the musky effluvia, he soon smelt out
the dandy, and thus addressed him:&mdash;"I say, mister, I can tell ye
what'll take that smell out of yer clothes: just bury 'em under ground
for a week. My uncle run agin a skunk once, and&mdash;" but before the
sentence was finished the enraged dandy sped from the crowd to escape
the shouts of laughter, while the innocent farmer, who only meant to
do him a kindness, was wondering what caused his sudden departure.</p>

<p>Several paragraphs (says a New York paper) have been going the rounds
in relation to the habits of great men, which paragraphs, as usual,
are all wrong; inasmuch as we have had the pleasure of dining and
hobnobbing with all the great men of this and every other country
on the face of the globe. An illustration will prove this to the
satisfaction of everybody. Mr. Seward generally rises from his bed
in the morning about the time he gets up. He rarely, if ever, eats
his breakfast before he gets it. He is not particular what kind of
food he has, if he is provided with what he calls for. In his dress
he is plain; never appearing in public without his pantaloons. He
never wears his vest outside of his coat. He speaks his native dialect
without a foreign accent. As an evidence of the methodical precision
with which he attends to business, it is only necessary to allude to
the fact that he invariably draws his salary the moment it is due; his
memory in this respect is prodigious. He generally writes on paper,
and uses a pen, which at intervals he dips into a stand of ink, that
he keeps upon his table.</p>

<p>The enrolling officer of Salisbury district, Maryland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> was very
active and thorough in the performance of his duty. One day he went
to the house of a countryman, and finding none of the male members of
the family at home, made inquiry of an old woman about the number and
age of the "males" of the family. After naming several, the old lady
stopped. "Is there no one else?" asked the officer. "No," replied the
woman; "none except Billy Bray." "Billy Bray! where is he?" "He was at
the barn a moment ago," said the old lady. Out went the officer, but
could not find the man. Coming back, the worthy officer questioned the
old lady as to the age of Billy, and went away, after enrolling his
name among those to be drafted. The time of the drafting came; among
those on whom the lot fell was Billy Bray. No one knew him. Where did
he live? The officer who enrolled him was called on to produce him;
and, lo and behold! Billy Bray was a <i>Jackass</i>! and stands now on the
list of drafted men as forming one of the quota of Maryland.</p>

<h3><a id="A_CITIZEN_OF_ALL_THE_STATES_84"></a>A CITIZEN OF ALL THE STATES.&mdash;84.</h3>

<p>A son of the Emerald Isle, but not himself green, was taken up (for
he was at the time down) near a rebel encampment not far from the
Manassas Junction. In a word, Pat was taking a quiet nap in the
shade, and was roused from his slumbers by a scouting party. He wore
no special uniform of either army, but looked more like a spy than
an alligator, and on this he was arrested. "Who are you?" "What is
your name?" and "Where are you from?" were the first questions put to
him by the armed party. Pat rubbed his eyes, scratched his head, and
answered: "By my faith, gintlemen, them is ugly questions to answer
any how; and before I answer any of them, I'd be after axin you, by
yer lave, the same thing." "Well," said the leader, "We are of Scott's
army, and belong to Washington." "All right," said Pat; "I know'd
ye was gintlemen, for I am the same. Long life to Gineral Scott!"
"Aha!" replied the scout, "now, you rascal, you are our prisoner," and
seized him by the shoulder. "How is that?" inquired Pat; "are we not
friends?" "No," was the answer; "we belong to General Beauregard's
army." "Then you told me a lie, me boys; and thinking it might be so,
I told you another. Now, tell me the truth, and I'll tell the truth
too." "Well, we belong to the State of South Carolina." "So do I,"
promptly responded Pat, "and to all the other States of the country
too; and there I'm thinking I bate the whole of ye. Do you think I
would come all the way from Ireland to belong to one State, when I had
a right to belong to the whole of 'em?"</p>

<p>Patrick Lyon, an Irishman, and Hans Heidelbrooke, a German, and their

families of both were increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> Pat's wife presenting him with
twins, and Hans' wife presenting him with one, all girls. The nurse
being desirous of contemplating the relative beauties of the little
cherubs, with the hopes of finding out if there is any difference
between a youthful Teuton and a cherub of Erin, got them so hopelessly
mixed that it was impossible to distinguish "tother from which." Here
was a terrible state of affairs. But the mother wit of the Irishwoman
solved the difficulty. She was entitled to two of the children any
how, and two she would take, and if either of them when grown up
should talk Dutch she would repudiate its paternity and lay claim to
the third. The Dutch woman coincided with the idea, and clasped to her
bosom the remaining child, resolved to watch for the first indication
of the brogue that might change her parental love to unmitigated
disgust.</p>


<h3><a id="DANIEL_WEBSTER_AND_WILLIAM_WIRT_86"></a>DANIEL WEBSTER AND WILLIAM WIRT.&mdash;86.</h3>

<p>Daniel Webster was once engaged in a case in one of the Virginia
courts, and the opposing counsel was William Wirt, author of the "Life
of Patrick Henry," which has been criticised as a brilliant romance.
In the progress of the case Mr. Webster produced a highly respectable
witness, whose testimony (unless disproved or impeached) settled the
case, and annihilated Mr. Wirt's client. After getting through the
testimony he informed Mr. Wirt, with a significant expression, that
he was through with the witness, and he was at his service. Mr. Wirt
rose to commence the cross-examination, but seemed for a moment quite
perplexed how to proceed, but quickly assumed a manner expressive
of his incredulity as to the facts elicited, and coolly eyeing the
witness a moment he said: "Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;, allow me to ask you whether you
have ever read a work called Baron Munchausen?" Before the witness had
time to reply, Mr. Webster quickly rose and said: "I beg your pardon,
Mr. Wirt, for the interruption, but there was one question I forgot to
ask the witness, and if you will allow me that favour I promise not
to interrupt you again." Mr. Wirt, in the blandest manner, replied,
"Yes, most certainly;" when Mr. Webster, in the most deliberate and
solemn manner, said: "Sir, have you ever read Wirt's 'Life of Patrick
Henry?'" The effect was so irresistible, that even the judge could not
control his rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> features. Mr. Wirt himself joined in the momentary
laugh, and turning to Mr. Webster said, "Suppose we submit this case
to the jury without summing up;" which was assented to, and Mr.
Webster's client won the case.</p>

<p>You have heard, perhaps, reader, of the encounter between an
Englishman and the market-woman at a fruit-stand in New York. The
Englishman had learned of the Yankee habit of bragging, and he thought
he would cut the comb of that propensity. He saw some huge watermelons

<p>"No, William Baker, you cannot have my daughter's hand in marriage
until you are equal in wealth and social position." The speaker
was a haughty old man of some sixty years, and the person whom he
addressed was a fine-looking young fellow of twenty-five. With a sad
aspect, the young man withdrew from the stately mansion. Six months
later he stood again in the presence of the haughty father, who thus
angrily addressed him: "What! you here again?" "Ah, old man," proudly
exclaimed William Baker, "I am here&mdash;your daughter's equal and yours!"
The old man's lip curled with scorn, a derisive smile lit up his cold
features; when casting violently upon the marble centre table an
enormous roll of greenbacks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> William Baker cried&mdash;"See! Look on this
wealth; and I've tenfold more! Listen, old man! You spurned me from
your door, but I did not despair. I secured a contract for furnishing
the army of the &mdash;&mdash; with beef&mdash;&mdash;" "Yes, yes!" eagerly exclaimed the
old man. "And I bought up all the disabled cavalry horses I could
find&mdash;&mdash;" "I see, I see!" cried the old man; "and good beef they make,
too." "They do, they do! and the profits are immense." "I should say
so." "And now, sir, I claim your daughter's fair hand." "Boy, she is
yours. But hold! Look me in the eye. Throughout all this have you
been loyal?" "To the core!" cried William Baker. "And," continued
the old man, in a voice husky with emotion, "are you in favour of a
vigorous prosecution of the war?" "I am, I am!" "Then, boy, take her!
Maria, child, come hither. Your William claims thee. Be happy, my
children! And, whatever our lot in life may be, let us all support the
Government."</p>


<h3><a id="DEMOSTHENES_NOT_DEAD_90"></a>DEMOSTHENES NOT DEAD.&mdash;90.</h3>

<p>They have orators out in Illinois, if we trust the description of
a certain military one, furnished us by a correspondent in that
State:&mdash;It was in dog-days, and a great hue and cry had been raised
about mad dogs. Although no person could be found who had seen one,
the excitement still grew by the rumours it was fed on. A meeting
of the citizens was called for the purpose of devising plans for
the extermination not only of mad dogs, but, to make safety doubly
sure, of dogs in general. The "brigadier" was appointed chairman.
After stating the objects of the meeting in a not very parliamentary
manner, instead of taking his seat and allowing others to make some
suggestions, he launched forth into a speech of some half-hour's
length, of which the following burst of forensic splendour is a
sample:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Feller Citizens</span>,&mdash;The time has come when the
overcharged feelings of aggrawated human natur are no longer to be
stood. Mad dogs are midst of us; their shriekin' yelp and fomy track
can be heered and seen on our peraries. Death follers in their wake;
shall we sit here like cowards while our lives and our neighbours'
lives are in danger from their dreadful vorashus hidrofobie caninety?
No, it mustn't be. E'en now my house is torn with conflictin' feelin's
of wrath and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> wengeance; a funeral pyre of wild cats is burstin'
within me. I have horses and cattle, I have sheep and pigs, I have
a wife and children, and," rising higher as the importance of the
subject deepened in his estimation, "I have money out at interest;
<i>all in danger of bein' bit by these infernal dogs</i>!"</p>

<p>A man, named Josh, was brought before a country squire for stealing
a hog, and three witnesses being examined swore they saw him steal
it. A wag, having volunteered as counsel for Josh, knowing the scope
of the squire's brain, arose and addressed him as follows:&mdash;"May it
please your honour, I can establish this man's honesty beyond the
shadow of a doubt, for I have twelve witnesses ready to swear that
they <span class="smcap">DID NOT</span> see him steal it." The squire rested his head
for a few moments upon his hand, as if in deep thought, and with great
dignity arose, and, brushing back his hair, said: "If there are twelve
who did not see him steal it, and only three who did, I discharge the
prisoner."</p>

<p>The street boot-blacks are one of the "institutions" of New York, as
well as of some other large cities. These boys are generally so polite
and so industrious that we rather like them, and sometimes take a
"shine up" just to see them work, and to chat with the smart little
fellows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> Here is a case illustrating their ingenuity:&mdash;A well-dressed
man standing at a hotel-door not long since was hailed by one of them
with the usual question, "Shine up, sir?" "What do you charge for
blacking boots?" asked the man, who was somewhat noted for stinginess.
"Five cents," was the reply. "Too much, too much; I'll give you three
cents," said the man. "All right," said the youngster, and at it he
went with might and main, and very soon had one boot shining like a
mirror; but, instead of commencing on the other he began to pack up
his brushes. "You havn't finished," exclaimed the man. "Never mind,"
replied the boot-black, with a twinkle in his eye; "I won't charge you
anything for what I've done; there comes a customer who pays." The
man glanced at the shining boot, then at the other, which was rusty
and bespattered with mud, thought of the ridiculous figure he would
make with <i>one</i> polished boot, and amid the laughter of the bystanders
agreed to give the sharp boy ten cents to finish the job, which he did
in double quick time, and with great pleasure.</p>

<h3><a id="LINCOLN_ON_NIGGER_MATHEMATICS_98"></a>LINCOLN ON NIGGER MATHEMATICS.&mdash;98.</h3>

<p>Our humorous Chief Magistrate was lately visited by one of the "On
to Richmond," sword of Gideon gentry, who confidently expressed the
hope so common among the abolition noodles, that Lee's army would be
"bagged." The President grinned to the utmost of his classic mouth,
and remarked that he was afraid there would be too much "nigger
mathematics" in it. The visitor smiled at the allusion, as he felt
bound in politeness to do, supposing there must be something in it,
though he could not see the point. "But I suppose you don't know what
'nigger mathematics' is?" continued Mr. Lincoln. "Lay down your hat
a minute and I'll tell you." He himself resumed the sitting posture,
leaned back in his chair, elevated his heels on the table, and went
on with his story. "There was a darky in my neighbourhood called
Pompey, who, from a certain quickness in figuring up the prices of
chickens and vegetables, got the reputation of being a mathematical
genius. Mr. Johnson, a darkey preacher, heard of Pompey and called
to see him. 'Here ye're a great mat'm'tishum, Pompey.' 'Yes sar, you
jas try.' 'Well, Pompey, Ize compound a problem in mat'matics.' 'All
right, sar.' 'Now Pompey, spose dere am tree pigeons sittin' on a
rail-fence, and you fire a gun at 'em and shoot one, how many's left?'
'Two, ob coors,' replies Pompey, after a little wool scratching.
'Ya! ya! ya!' laughs Mr. Johnson; 'I knowed you was a fool, Pompey;
dere's none left; one's dead, and dudder two's flown away.' That's
what makes me say," continued Mr. Lincoln, "that I am afraid there was
too much 'nigger mathematics' in the Pennsylvania campaign." And the
result showed that in this instance, at least, the anecdote suited the
fact. Lee's army was the three pigeons. One of them was taken down at
Gettysburg, but the other two flew over the Potomac.</p>

this is a great phenomena&mdash;indeed, the greatest of the world. The

world: a city sacked and burned&mdash;a London in the midst of a plague&mdash;a
ship burning at sea&mdash;a family pining in starvation&mdash;a jug of molasses
wrecked on the pavement; but the saddest sight to us of all is an old
bachelor, stolidly walking towards his end, his great duties undone,
his shirt buttons off, his stockings out at the toes, and nobody to
leave his money to. Were we such a man, the mild, reproving eye of
a widow or maiden lady would drive us mad. But there is still hope.
Uglier and older men than any of our friends have married beautiful
wives, who trained them admirably, and spent their money elegantly."</p>

<i>patience of Job</i>." Now, in the first place, Job <i>wasn't</i> patient. Like all the
rest of his sex, from that day to the present, he could be heroic only
for a time. He <i>began</i> bravely, but ended, as most of them do under
annoyance, by cursing and swearing. Patient as Job! Did Job ever try,
when he was hungry, to eat shad with a frisky baby in his lap? Did Job
ever try, after nursing one all night, and upon taking his seat at the
breakfast-table the morning after, to pour out coffee for six people,
and second cups at that, before he had a chance to take a mouthful
himself? Pshaw! I've no patience with "Job's patience." It is of no
use to multiply instances; but there's not a faithful house-mother in
the land who does not out-distance him in the sight of men and angels
every hour in the twenty-four.</p>

<p>"I was down to see the widow yesterday," said Tim's uncle, "and

talked, and laughed, and chatted, and run on, she going out and in
occasionally, till dinner was ready, when she helped me graciously to
a piece of pie. Now I thought that, Tim, rather favourable. I took it
as a symptom of personal approbation, because everybody knows I love
pigeon pie, and I flattered myself she had cooked it on purpose for
me. So I grew particularly cheerful, and thought I could see it in
her too. So, after dinner, while sitting close beside the widow, I
fancied we both felt kind of comfortable like: I know I did. I fell
over head and ears in love with her, and I imagined, from the way she
looked, she had fallen in love with me. She appeared for all the world
as if she thought it was coming. Presently&mdash;I couldn't help it&mdash;I
laid my hand softly on her beautiful shoulder, and I remarked, when I
placed it there, in my blandest tones, Tim&mdash;for I tried to throw my
whole soul into the expression&mdash;I remarked, then, with my eyes pouring
love, truth, and fidelity right into hers: 'Widow, this is the nicest,
softest place I ever had my hand in all my life!' Looking benevolently
at me, and at the same time flushing up a little, she said, in melting
and winning tones: 'Doctor, give me your hand, and I'll put it on a
much softer place.' In a moment, in rapture, I consented, and, taking
my hand, she very gently, Tim, and quietly laid it on my head. Now,
Tim, I havn't told this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to a livin' soul but you, and, by jinks! you

<p>A man near Cleveland, Ohio, applied for exemption from the draft
because an old mother needed his cherishing care. To show how much
feeling this affectionate son has for his old mother, the neighbours
say he has had her coffin in the house for over two years. He came
to town with a load of wood one day, and being unable to sell it, he
contrived to trade it off with an undertaker for a coffin. His mother
being old, might die suddenly, and then, as Mrs. Toddles says, "how
handy it would be to have in the house." Being of a frugal as well as
an ingenious turn of mind, he put the coffin in the cellar to keep
turnips, against such time as the old lady might drop off.</p>

<p>We like short courtships, and in this Adam acted like a sensible man.
He fell asleep a bachelor, and awoke to find himself a married man. He
appeared to have popped the question almost immediately after meeting
Mademoiselle Eve, and she without any flirtation or shyness, gave him
a kiss and herself. Of this first event in the world, we have however,
our thoughts, and sometimes in a poetical mood have wished that we
were the man that did it. But the deed is done. The chance was Adam's
and he improved it. We like the notion of getting married in a garden;
it is a good taste. We like a private wedding&mdash;Adam's was private. No
envious beaux were there; no croaking old maids; no chattering aunts
and grumbling grandmothers. The birds of heaven were the minstrels,
and the glad sky flung its light upon the scene. One thing about
the wedding brings queer thoughts to us spite of scriptural truth.
Adam and his wife were rather young to be married&mdash;some two or three
days old, according to the sagest speculations of theologians; mere
babies&mdash;larger, but no older; without experience, without a house,
without a pot or kettle&mdash;nothing but love and Eden.</p>

a little girl the manner in which a lobster casts his shell when he
has outgrown it, said: "What do you do when you have outgrown your
clothes? You cast them aside, do you not?" "Oh, no!" replied the
little one, "we let out the tucks!" The lecturer confessed she had the
advantage of him there.</p>

stand reprimanded, and he concluded thus:&mdash;"You may go now, John,

beaming in his eyes, and a broad grin, displaying a beautiful row
of ivory, replied: "I wouldn't been here dis time, Judge, only de

Uncle Sam, "a great difference. Before, when he went out to mend his
fences on Sunday, he carried his axe on his shoulder, but now he
carries it under his over-coat."</p>

<p>Some friends of ours in Ohio have a little boy about six years old,

the house. Her disappointed brother followed, crying, "Mother, mother!
Suzy, she's been and got the egg the old hen measures by!"</p>

<h3><a id="WOMAN-OLOGY_118"></a>WOMAN-OLOGY.&mdash;118.</h3>

<p>We (<i>Home Journal</i>) wish to be learned in the subtle science of
the softer sex. We aspire to know, at least, what it is that makes
woman so adorable as magnetism pronounces her to be, and we have
seen nothing so tributary to this science as an article in "Once a
Month," entitled "The Good that hath been said of Woman." From the
pleasant little periodical we speak of (edited by a younger brother of
our own), we quote thus largely:&mdash;"One day the Fairy Blue descended
upon earth with the courteous intention of distributing to all her
daughters, inhabitants of different lands, the treasures and favours
she brought with her. Her dwarf, Amaranth, sounded his horn, and
immediately a young girl of each nation presented herself at the foot
of the throne of Fairy Blue. This happened a long time before the
revolution of July, 1830. The good Fairy Blue said to all her friends:
'I desire that none of you shall have to complain of the gift I am
about to make you. It is not in my power to give each of you the
same thing; but such want of uniformity in my largesses, should that
deprive them of all merit?' As time is precious to the fairies, they
say but little. Fairy Blue here finished her speech, and commenced the
distribution of her gifts. She gave to the young girl who represented
the Castiles, hair so black and so long that she could make a mantilla
of it. To the Italian girl she gave eyes, sparkling and brilliant as
an eruption of Vesuvius at midnight. To the Turkish, an <i>embonpoint</i>
round as the moon, and soft as eider-down. To the English, an
aurora-borealis, to tint her cheeks, her lips, her shoulders. To the
German, such teeth as she had herself, and what is not worth less
than pretty teeth, but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> has its price, a feeling heart, and
one profoundly disposed to love. To the Russian girl she gave the
distinction of a queen. Then, passing to detail, she placed gaiety
upon the lips of a Neapolitan girl, wit in the head of an Irish, good
sense in the heart of a Flemish; and when she had no more to give,
she prepared to take her flight. 'And I?' said the Parisian girl,
retaining her by her blue tunic. 'I had forgotten you.' 'Entirely
forgotten, Madam?' 'You were too near me, and I did not perceive you.
But what can I do now? The bag of gifts is exhausted.'"</p>

used to be loafing about the premises. One day, in a social mood,
Biddle said to the darkey, "Well, what is your name, my old friend?"
"Harry, sir&mdash;ole Harry," said the other, touching his seedy hat. "Old
Harry," said Biddle; "why, that is the name they give to the devil, is
it not?" "Yes, sir," said the coloured gentleman; "sometimes ole Harry
and sometimes ole Nick."</p>

<h3><a id="PUTTING_FORWARD_HIS_CREED_121"></a>PUTTING FORWARD HIS CREED.&mdash;121.</h3>

<p>The gentleman who edits the <i>Kentucky Rifle</i>, having been taken to
task by a lady correspondent as to what constituted his particular
faith, thus puts forward his creed:&mdash;"We believe that Mrs. Zebedee
was a nice woman and that Mr. Zebedee was the father of his own
children. We believe that guano and lime mixed together will make
splendid hartshorn. It is our opinion that a donkey's kick and editing
a newspaper are two of the hardest things in creation. We believe
that getting 'tight' loosens the morals, but we shall always contend
that it is cheaper in the long run to try the experiment with good
whisky than with a mean article. We believe that a man who can be kept
awake six nights in the week with jumping toothache, and be 'roused'
by a squalling baby just as he has fallen into a doze on the seventh
night, without getting mad or wondering why babies and toothache were
invented, is a greater philosopher than Newton, and a greater hero
than Leonidas and all his Spartans put together. We believe that a man
is not likely to be sick so often if he pays his physician by the year
as if he pays him by the visit. We believe that every well-regulated
family ought always to have one baby in it, just for the fun of the
thing. We believe that the man who invented tallow candles must have
been too poor to afford pine-knots. It is our opinion that if a number
of gentlemen are sitting together talking sensibly upon some subject,
and a lady enters, they will immediately commence talking foolishly
and keep it up until she makes her exit. We believe they do so by way
of complimentary condescension to female weakness."</p>

cast. "A friend is best found in adversity." Not so&mdash;for then there
is none to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> found. "The pride of the rich makes the labour of the

<h3><a id="A_NICE_GIRL_124"></a>A NICE GIRL.&mdash;124.</h3>

<p>There is nothing half so sweet in life&mdash;half so beautiful, or
delightful, or so loveable&mdash;as a "nice girl." Not a pretty, or a
dashing, or an elegant girl, but a <i>nice</i> girl. One of those lovely,
lively, good-tempered, good-hearted, sweet-faced, amiable, neat,
happy, domestic creatures met within the sphere of home, diffusing
around the domestic hearth the influence of her goodness like the
essence of sweet flowers. A nice girl is not the languishing beauty,
dawdling on a sofa, and discussing the last novel or opera; or the
giraffe-like creature sweeping majestically through a drawing-room.
The nice girl may not even dance or play well, and knows nothing
about "using her eyes," or coquetting with a fan. She is not given to
sensation novels&mdash;she is too busy. At the opera, she is not in front
showing her bare shoulders, but sits quietly and unobtrusively&mdash;at
the back of the box most likely. In fact, it is not often in such
scenes we discover her. Home is her place. Who rises betimes, and
superintends the morning meal? Who makes the toast and the tea, and
buttons the boys' shirts, and waters the flowers, and feeds the
chickens, and brightens up the parlour and sitting-room? Is it the
languisher, or the giraffe, or the <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gante</i>? Not a bit of it&mdash;it's
the nice girl. Her unmade toilet is made in the shortest possible
time; yet how charmingly it is done, and how elegant her neat dress
and plain colour! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> kisses she distributes among the family! No
presenting a cheek or a brow, like a "fine girl," but an audible
smack, which says plainly, "I love you ever so much." If I ever
coveted anything, it is one of the nice girl's kisses. Breakfast
over, down in the kitchen to see about dinner; always cheerful and
light-hearted. She never ceases to be active and useful until the day
is done, when she will polka with the boys, and sing old songs, and
play old tunes to her father for hours together. She is a perfect
treasure, is the "nice girl," when illness comes; it is she that
attends with unwearying patience to the sick chamber. There is no
risk, no fatigue that she will not undergo, no sacrifice that she will
not make. She is all love, all devotion. I have often thought it would
be happiness to be ill, to be watched by such loving eyes and tended
by such fair hands. One of the most strongly marked characteristics
of a "nice girl" is tidiness and simplicity of dress. She is ever
associated in my mind with a high frock, plain collar, and the
neatest of neck-ribbons, bound with the most modest little brooch in
the world. I never knew a "nice girl" who displayed a profusion of
rings and bracelets, or who wore low dresses or a splendid bonnet.
I say again, there is nothing in the world half so beautiful, half
so intrinsically good, as a "nice girl." She is the sweetest flower
in the path of life. There are others far more stately, far more
gorgeous, but these we merely admire as we go by. It is where the
daisy grows that we lie down to rest.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Herald's</i> Morris Island correspondent relates as follows
an incident of the operations at Charleston:&mdash;Quite an uproar was
occasioned in the rear of the <i>Herald's</i> tent here yesterday. General
Terry, whose head-quarters adjoin those of your correspondent, has a
sable cook, who wanted some lead for his fishing-tackle, and undertook
to melt some from the outside of a ten-pound Parrot shell, which he
discovered lying about the camp. Placing the projectile in a stove,
and seating himself where he could catch the molten metal in a shovel
as it fell, he soon had the satisfaction of seeing one of the most
startling views ever brought to his vision. The shell exploded, and
besides blowing the stove and cookhouse to atoms, inflicted serious
wounds upon the darkey. My servant, a contraband from Beaufort, gave
vent to the universal sentiment, while he was surveying the wreck
which the explosion occasioned, and from which we so narrowly escaped,
in the following sage remark:&mdash;"De dam ole fool, come clar gown yere
f'm Bos'n an' put a shell in de stove!" If General Terry's niggers
continue to obtain their "sinkers" in this manner, you may expect to
hear that the <i>Herald's</i> head-quarters have been removed.</p>

<p>Varnum S. Mills, of this city, tells a story illustrative of the
simplicity of Virginia niggers. He was visiting a friend in the Old
Dominion, who owns many slaves, among whom were two, named Sambo and
Cuffee, who seemed to be mortal enemies. Sambo was a favourite with
the master, who one day said to him: "Sambo, you have always been a
good nigger, and when you die you shall have a funeral. My family will
all attend, and all the niggers shall be present, and Cuffee shall
be a pall-bearer." The darkey looked his master in the face with the
simplicity of a soft clam when dug out of the mud at low tide, and
indignantly responded: "Massa, if Cuffee comes to de funeril, I won't
go to the grabe." It apparently did not occur to Sambo that he should
be "conveyed" thither.</p>

<h3><a id="CURIOSITIES_OF_AMERICAN_SPEECH_148"></a>CURIOSITIES OF AMERICAN SPEECH.&mdash;148.</h3>

<p>In a book on Americanisms, published last year, a Baltimore young
lady is represented as jumping up from her seat, on being asked to
dance, and saying, "Yes, sirree: for I have sot, and sot, and sot,
till I've nigh tuk root!" I cannot say I have heard anything quite
equal to this; but I very well remember that at a party given on
board one of the ships at Esquimault, a young lady declined to dance
a "fancy" dance upon the plea, "I'd rather not, sir. I guess I'm not
<i>fixed up</i> for waltzing;" an expression the peculiar meaning of which
must be left to readers of her own sex to decide. An English young
lady who was staying at one of the houses at Mare Island when we were
there, happened one evening, when we were visiting her friends, to
be confined to her room with a headache. Upon our arrival, the young
daughter of our host&mdash;a girl of bout twelve&mdash;went up to her to try to
persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> her to come down. "Well," she said, "I'm <i>real</i> sorry you're
so poorly. You'd better come, for there are some almighty swells down
there!" A lady speaking of the same person, said, "Her hair, sir, took
my fancy right away!" Again, several of us were one day talking to a
tall, slight young lady about the then new-fashioned crinoline which
she was wearing. After a little banter, she said, "I guess, captain,
if you were to take my hoops off you might draw me through the eye of
a needle!" Perhaps one of the most whimsical of these curiosities of
expression, combining freedom of manner with that of speech, was made
use of to Captain Richards by a master-caulker. He had been vainly
endeavouring to persuade the captain that the ship required caulking;
and at last he said in disgust, "You may be liberal as a private
citizen, captain, but you're mean to an almighty pump-tack!"&mdash;in his
official capacity of course. Again, an American gentleman on board
of one of our mail-packets was trying to recall to the recollection
of the mail-agent a lady who had been fellow-passenger with them on
a former occasion. "She sat opposite you at table all the voyage,"
he said. "Oh, I think I remember her; she ate a great deal, did she
not?" "Eat, sir!" was the reply; "she was a perfect gastronomic
fillibuster!" One more example and I have done with a subject upon
which I might enlarge for pages. The boys at the school at Victoria
were being examined in Scripture, and the question was asked, "In what
way did Hiram assist Solomon in the building of the temple?" It passed
two or three boys, when at last one sharp little fellow triumphantly
exclaimed, "Please, sir, he <i>donated</i> him the lumber."</p>


<h3><a id="VERY_LIKELY_149"></a>VERY LIKELY.&mdash;149.</h3>

<p>"From Camden to Bletchly, a distance of forty miles I travelled along
with Mrs. Greaves. She was a sweet and interesting woman&mdash;so sweet
and interesting that, fastidious as I am on the subject, I believe I
would have been willing to have kissed her. I had, however, several
reasons for not perpetrating this act. First, I am such a good husband
I wouldn't even be guilty of the appearance of disloyalty to my sweet
wife. Second, I was afraid our fellow-passengers would see me and tell
Greaves. Third, I do not think Mrs. G. would let me."</p>

<h3><a id="CURIOUS_EVENT_150"></a>CURIOUS EVENT.&mdash;150.</h3>

<p>A diffident Hartford bachelor went to the sea-shore in August to seek
refuge from the loneliness of his celibacy, and one dark evening,
enjoying the breeze on the piazza of his hotel, happened to take a
seat that had just been vacated by the husband of a loving wife,
with whom the happy man had been chatting. In a few moments the lady
returned, and, mistaking the stranger for her husband, lovingly
encircled his neck and gave him an affectionate kiss, with the remark,
"Come, darling, is it not about time to retire?" He did not faint, but
the shock was very severe.</p>


<h3><a id="HOT_PIES_151"></a>HOT PIES.&mdash;151.</h3>

<p>One freezing February morning a negro hawked mutton pies in a basket
around Faneuil Hall Square, roaring out, "Hot mutton pies!" "Hot
mutton pies!" A teamster bought and tried to bite one, but found it
frozen as solid as the curb-stone. "What do you call them hot for, you
black and blue swindler?" yelled the teamster to the shivering pieman.
"Wy, wy, a white man guv 'em to me hot dis mornin'. Dey was hot wen
I got 'em dis mornin'!" "Well, you fool, it didn't take ten minutes
to freeze them in that old basket. Why call them hot now?" "Wy, bless
you, dats de name ob 'em&mdash;de name ob 'em! If I didn't holler de right
name nobody would tetch 'em. You want me to holler froze pies, I
suppose! No, sa; you can't fool me dat way!"</p>


<h3><a id="A_MIGHTY_THICK_FOG_152"></a>A MIGHTY THICK FOG.&mdash;152.</h3>

<p>A rather loquacious individual was endeavouring to draw an old man
into conversation, but hitherto without much success, the old fellow
having sufficient discernment to see that his object was to make
a little sport for the passengers at his expense. At length says
loquacious individual: "I suppose you consider Down East a right smart
place; but I guess it would puzzle them to get up quite so thick a fog
as we are having here this morning, wouldn't it?" "Well," said the
old man, "I don't know about that. I hired one of your Massachusetts
chaps to work for me last summer, and one rather foggy mornin' I sent
him down to the meadow to lay a few courses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> shingle on a new barn
I was finishin' off. At dinner-time the fellow came up, and, sez he,
'That's an almighty long barn of yourn.' Sez I, 'Not very long.'
'Well,' sez he, 'I've been to work all this forenoon, and haven't got
one course laid yet.' 'Well,' sez I, 'you're a lazy fellow, that's all
I've got to say.' And so after dinner I went down to see what he'd
been about, and I'll be thundered ef he hadn't shingled more than a
hundred foot <i>right out on to the fog</i>."</p>


<h3><a id="WHISKERS_AND_KISSES_153"></a>WHISKERS AND KISSES.&mdash;153.</h3>

<p>The editress of the <i>Lancaster Literary Gazette</i> says she would as
soon nestle her nose in a rat's nest of swingle tow as allow a man
with whiskers on to kiss her. We (<i>Petersburg Express</i>) don't believe
a word of it. The objections which some ladies pretend to have to
whiskers all arise from envy. They don't have any. They would if they
could; but the fact is, the continual motion of the lower jaw is fatal
to their growth. The ladies&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;adopt our fashion as
far as they can. Look at the depredations they have committed on our
wardrobes the last few years. They have appropriated our shirt-bosoms,
gold studs and all. They have encircled their soft bewitching necks
in our standing collars and cravats&mdash;driving them to flatties and
turn-downs. Their innocent little hearts have been palpitating in the
inside of our waistcoats, instead of thumping against the outside,
as naturally intended. They have thrust their pretty feet and ankles
through our unmentionables, unwhisperables, unthinkaboutables; and
they are skipping along the streets in our high-heeled boots. Do you
hear, gentlemen?&mdash;we say boots!</p>


<h3><a id="LITTLES_154"></a>LITTLES.&mdash;154.</h3>

<p>Everything is beautiful when it is little (except souls!)&mdash;little
pigs, little lambs, little birds, little kittens, little children.
Little Martin boxes of houses are generally the most happy and cozy;
little villages are nearer to being atoms of a shattered paradise
than anything we know of. Little fortunes bring the most content, and
little hopes the least disappointment. Little words are the sweetest
to hear, and little charities fly furthest and stay the longest on
the wing. Little lakes are the stillest, little hearts the fullest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and little farms the best tilled. Little books the most read, and
little songs the best loved. And when Nature would make anything
especially rare and beautiful, she makes it little&mdash;little pearls,
little diamonds, little dews. Agar's is a model prayer, but then it
is a little prayer, and the burden of the petition is for little.
The Sermon on the Mount is little, but the last dedication discourse
was two hours. The Roman said, "<i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>"&mdash;I came, saw,
conquered; but despatches now-a-days are longer than the battles they
tell of. Everybody calls that little which they love best upon earth.
We once heard a good sort of a man speak of his little wife, and we
fancied she must be a perfect <i>bijou</i> of a woman. We saw her; she
weighed two hundred and ten; we were surprised. But then it was no
joke&mdash;the man meant it. He could put his wife in his heart, and have
room for other things besides; and what was she but precious, and what
could she be but little? We rather doubt the stories of great argosies
of gold we sometimes hear of, for Nature deals in littles altogether.
Life is made up of littles, death is what remains of them all. Day
is made up of little beams, and night is glorious with little stars.
<i>Multum in parvo</i>&mdash;much in little&mdash;is the great beauty of all that we
love best, hope for most, and remember longest.</p>

<p>"My dear Ellen," said Mr. Softfellow to a young lady whose smiles

I hardly dare trust myself now to speak the deep emotions of my
palpitating heart; but I declare to you, my dearest Ellen, that I love
you most tenderly; your smiles would shed&mdash;would shed&mdash;&mdash;" "Never mind
the wood-shed," said Ellen, "go on with that pretty talk."</p>


<h3><a id="SPIRITUALISM_EXTRAORDINARY_156"></a>SPIRITUALISM EXTRAORDINARY.&mdash;156.</h3>

<p>An enthusiastic spiritualist, when relating to a sceptic certain
spiritual performances to which he could testify, said that on one
occasion the spirit of his wife, who had been dead several years,
returned to him, and, seating herself on his knee, put her arms around
him and kissed him, much to his gratification, as she used to do when
living. "You do not mean to say," remarked the sceptic, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> the
spirit of your wife really embraced you and kissed you?" "No, not
exactly that," replied the believer; "but her spirit took possession
of the female medium&mdash;the future Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; that is to be, you
know&mdash;and through her embraced and kissed me."</p>


<h3><a id="MILWAUKEE_ELOQUENCE_157"></a>MILWAUKEE ELOQUENCE.&mdash;157.</h3>

<p>Western eloquence continues to improve. A Wisconsin reporter sends the
following sketch. A lawyer in Milwaukee was defending a handsome young
woman accused of stealing from a large unoccupied dwelling in the
night-time, and thus he spake in conclusion:&mdash;"Gentlemen of the jury,
I am done. When I gaze with enraptured eyes on the matchless beauty
of this peerless virgin, on whose resplendent charms suspicion never
dared to breathe; when I behold her radiant in this glorious bloom
of lustrous loveliness, which angelic sweetness might envy but could
not eclipse&mdash;before which the star on the brow of Night grows pale,
and the diamonds of Brazil are dim&mdash;and then reflect upon the utter
madness and folly of supposing that so much beauty would expose itself
to the terrors of an empty building in the cold, damp, dead of night,
when innocence like hers is hiding itself amidst the snowy pillows of
repose; gentlemen of the jury, my feelings are too overpowering for
expression, and I throw her into your arms for protection against this
foul charge, which the outrageous malice of a disappointed scoundrel
has invented, to blast the fair name of this lovely maiden, whose
smile shall be the reward of the verdict which I know you will give."</p>


<h3><a id="HEAVY_TOP-DRESSING_158"></a>HEAVY TOP-DRESSING.&mdash;158.</h3>

<p>"It's all very pretty talk," said a recently married old bachelor, who
had just finished reading an essay on the "Culture of Women," just as
a heavy milliner's bill was presented to him&mdash;"it's all very pretty,
this cultivation of women; but such a charge as this for bonnets is
rather a heavy top-dressing&mdash;in my judgment."</p>

<p>"I am willing to split hairs with my opponent all day if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> he insists
on it," said a very distinguished American lawyer the other day, in a
speech at the bar. "Split <i>that</i> then," said the opponent, pulling a
coarse specimen from his own head, and extending it. "May it please
the court, I didn't say <i>bristles</i>!"</p>


<h3><a id="ANTEDILUVIAN_DIET_160"></a>ANTEDILUVIAN DIET.&mdash;160.</h3>

<p>A friend thinks the antediluvian life must have been a great contrast
to ours, and pictures it thus:&mdash;"Only fancy having two dried whales
hanging in your larder, and a cold mammoth 'cut and come again' on the
sideboard. 'Shall I help you to a bit of Icthoyaturns?' 'Thank you, I
should prefer a slice of your Mastadon.' Stewed Plesiosauri! Leviathan
<i>&agrave; la crapoderie</i>! Imagine a bill, not at twelve months, but at two
hundred years; and a fellow who carried off your plate-box getting
sent to the treadmill for fourscore summers! Consider an elderly
gentleman, with a liver complaint of only one hundred years' standing,
wearing out four sets of false teeth, and finally carried off, after
a brief illness of three hundred and ten years, in a galloping
consumption!"</p>


<h3><a id="JIMMY_ONEIL_AND_PRESIDENT_JACKSON_161"></a>JIMMY O'NEIL AND PRESIDENT JACKSON.&mdash;161.</h3>

<p>When Jackson was President, Jimmy O'Neil, the porter, was a
marked character. He had his foibles, which were offensive to the
fastidiousness of Colonel Donelson, and caused his dismissal on an
average of about once a week. But on appeal to the higher court,
the verdict was invariably reversed by the good nature of the old
general. Once, however, Jimmy was guilty of some flagrant offence,
and was summoned before the highest tribunal at once. The general,
after stating the details of the misdeed, observed, "Jimmy, I have
borne with you for years, in spite of all complaints; but in this act
you have gone beyond my powers of endurance." "And do you believe
the story?" asked Jimmy. "Certainly," answered the general: "I have
just heard it from two senators." "Faith," retorted Jimmy, "if I
believe all that twenty senators say about you it's little I'd think
you are fit to be President." "Pshaw! Jimmy," concluded the general;
"clear out and go on duty, but be more careful hereafter." Jimmy
remained with his kind-hearted patron not only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> the close of his
presidential term, but, accompanying him to the Hermitage, was with
him to the day of his death.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_ORIGIN_OF_SOME_PUNKIN_162"></a>THE ORIGIN OF "SOME PUNKIN."&mdash;162.</h3>

<p>An old lady was engaged in making pumpkin pies; she had got the
pumpkin all prepared, when by an untoward accident the table was
overturned, and the pumpkin went on to the floor. The table in
overturning overset the slop-pail, and the slops went on the floor
too. The old lady being of a saving disposition, concluded to save
the pumpkin and clean up also; so she takes up one handful, looks
at it&mdash;"That's punkin"&mdash;puts it into the pumpkin-dish; takes up
another&mdash;"That's slops"&mdash;puts it into the slop-pail. So she goes on
picking up alternately pumpkin and slops, till finally she gets a
handful mixed. She looks at it, and says, "That is <i>some punkin</i>, but
mostly slops!" and hence the phrase.</p>

As some of the men ran towards the darkey, of course carrying their

<h3><a id="HIS_FIRST_STEP_171"></a>HIS FIRST STEP.&mdash;171.</h3>

<p>We extract the following from a popular story. It narrates the early
experience of a bashful boy:&mdash;"Well, my sister Lib gave a party one
night, and I stayed away from home because I was too bashful to face
the music. I hung around the house, whistling 'Old Dan Tucker,'
dancing to keep my feet warm, watching heads bobbing up and down
behind the window-curtains, and wishing the thundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> party would
break up so I could get to my room. I smoked up a bunch of cigars, and
as it was getting late and mighty uncomfortable, I concluded to climb
up the door-post. No sooner said than done, and I found myself snug
in bed. 'Now,' says I, 'let her rip! Dance till your wind is out!'
And, cuddled under the quilts, Morpheus grabbed me. I was dreaming
of soft-shelled crabs and stewed tripe, and having a good time, when
somebody knocked at my room-door and woke me up. 'Rap,' again. I laid
low. 'Rap, rap, rap!' Then I heard a whispering, and I knew there was
a whole raft of girls outside. 'Rap, rap!' Then Lib sings out, 'Jack,
are you in there?' 'Yes,' says I; and then came a roar of laughter.
'Let us in,' says she. 'I won't,' says I. Then came another laugh. By
thunder, I began to get riled! 'Get out, you petticoated scarecrows!'
I cried; 'can't you get a beau without hauling a fellow out of bed? I
won't go home with you&mdash;I won't&mdash;so you may clear out!' And sending a
boot at the door, I felt better. But presently&mdash;O mortal buttons!&mdash;I
heard a still small voice, very like sister Lib's, and it said, 'Jack,
you'll have to get up, for all the girls' things are in there!' Oh
dear, what a pickle! Think of me in bed, all covered with shawls,
muffs, bonnets, and cloaks, and twenty girls outside waiting to get
in. As it was, I rolled out among the ribbons in a hurry. Smash went
the millinery in every direction. I had to dress in the dark, and the
way I fumbled about was death on straw hats. The critical moment at
last came. I opened the door, and found myself right among the women!
'Oh, my Leghorn!' cries one. 'My dear winter velvet!' cries another.
And they pinched in&mdash;they piled me this way and that&mdash;boxed my ears;
and one little bright-eyed piece&mdash;Sal &mdash;&mdash;, her name was&mdash;put her
arms right round my neck and kissed me right on my lips! Human nature
couldn't stand that, and I gave her as good as she sent. It was the
first time I had ever got a taste, and it was powerful good. I believe
I could have kissed that gal from Julius C&aelig;sar to the Fourth of July.
'Jack,' said she, 'we are sorry to disturb you, but won't you see me
home?' 'Yes,' says I, 'I will.' I did do it, and had another smack at
the gate, too. After that we took a kinder turtle-doving after each
other, both of us sighing like a barrel of new cider when we were away

<h3><a id="HIS_WIFES_COUSIN_172"></a>HIS WIFE'S COUSIN.&mdash;172.</h3>

<p>A country gentleman lately arrived at Boston, and immediately repaired
to the house of a relative, a lady who had married a merchant. The
parties were glad to see him, and invited him to make their house his
home, as he declared his intention of remaining in the city only a
day or two. The husband of the lady, anxious to show his attention
to a relative and friend of his wife, took the gentleman's horse
to a livery stable in Hanover Street. Finally his visit became a
visitation, and the merchant found, after the lapse of eleven days,
besides lodging and boarding the gentleman, a pretty considerable
bill had run up at the livery stable. Accordingly he went to the man
who kept the livery stable, and told him when the gentleman took his
horse he would pay the bill. "Very well," said the stable-keeper, "I
understand you." Accordingly, in a short time the country gentleman
went to the stable and ordered his horse to be got ready. The bill, of
course, was presented to him. "Oh," said the gentleman, "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, my
relative, will pay this." "Very good," said the stable-keeper, "please
get an order from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;; it will be the same as money." The horse
was put up again, and down went the country gentleman to Long Wharf,
which the merchant kept. "Well," said he, "I am going now." "Are you?"
said the gentleman. "Well, good-bye, sir." "Well, about my horse; the
man said the bill must be paid for his keeping." "Well, I suppose that
is all right, sir." "Yes&mdash;well, but you know I'm your wife's cousin."
"Yes," said the merchant, "I know you are, but your horse is not."</p>

and may they both perish in the last ditch together." "State
rights&mdash;May they not be forgotten in delirious and bloody triumph
of State wrongs." "Things we remember&mdash;Habeas corpus and trial by
jury." "To the first Governor who shall have the virtue and courage
to keep his oath of office, and defend the constitution, laws, and
sovereignty of his State, and the rights of its citizens." "The light
of other days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> when Liberty wore a white face, and America was not a
negro." "The Democratic party, as it was, before cowardice, treachery,
shoddy, and greenbacks had demoralized its councils." "The abolition
war for disunion&mdash;Let those who think it is right go to it, and those
who think it is wrong stay at home." "May those who say we shall
never have the Union as it was follow the example of their brother
traitor, Judas Iscariot, who died and went to his own place." "The
war Democrat&mdash;A white man's face on the body of a negro." "The only
possible remedy for secession and the only hope of the Union&mdash;Peace,
mutual concession, and compromise."</p>

&amp;c., several times, could enumerate but eight. He said he was certain

that you have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> barrel of ale in your room." "Yes, sir." "Well,
what explanation can you make?" "Why, the fact is, sir, my physician
advises me to try a little each day as a tonic; and, not wishing to
stop at the various places where the beverage is retailed, I concluded
to have a barrel taken to my room." "Indeed! and have you derived any
benefit from the use of it?" "Ah! yes, sir. When the barrel was first
taken to my room I could scarcely lift it; now I can carry it with the

"Well, was there any light shining from any house near by?" "Why,
no; there wasn't a house within a mile of us." "Well, then, if there
was no moon, no starlight, no light from any house, and so dark you
couldn't even see your hand before your face, how are you so positive

<p>In one of the fierce engagements with the rebels near Mechanicsville,
in May last, a young lieutenant of a Rhode Island battery had his
right foot so shattered by a fragment of a shell that on reaching
Washington he was obliged to undergo amputation of the leg. He
telegraphed home, hundreds of miles away, that all was going well, and
with a soldier's fortitude composed himself to bear his sufferings
alone. Unknown to him, however, his mother, one of those dear reserves
of the army, hastened up to join the main force. She reached the city
at midnight, and the nurses would have kept her from him until the
morning. One sat by his side fanning him as he slept, her hand on the
feeble fluctuating pulsations which foreboded sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> results. But what
woman's heart could resist the pleadings of a mother then? In the
darkness she was finally allowed to glide in and take the place at his
side. She touched his pulse as the nurse had done, not a word had been
spoken, but the sleeping boy opened his eyes and said, "That feels
like my mother's hand; who is this beside me? It is my mother; turn up
the gas and let me see mother!" The two dear faces met in one long,
joyful, sobbing embrace, and the fondness pent up in each heart sobbed
and panted and wept forth its expression.</p>

too good to be lost:&mdash;"Who, my bretherin, can describe the glory of

put it on your shoulders for epaulettes&mdash;if you tear down the starry

"That would depend on who asked me." Then sez I, "Suppose it was Ned

staggered me; but I was too cute to lose the opportunity, and so sez
I again, "Suppose it was me?" And then you orter see her pout up her
lip, and says she, "I don't take no supposes." Wall, now, you see
there was nothin' for me to do but touch the gun off. So bang it went.
Sez I, "Wall, Hetty, it's me; won't you say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> yes?" And then there was

exactly, but I once saw him sitting in the middle of the floor, making
grabs in the air, and saying that he'd be dogoned if he don't catch

<h3><a id="PRESIDENTIAL_PUNS_196"></a>PRESIDENTIAL PUNS.&mdash;196.</h3>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, in his happier moments, is not always reminded of a
"little story," but often indulges in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> veritable joke. One of the
latest reported is his remark when he found himself attacked by the
varioloid. He had been recently very much worried by people asking
favours. "Well," said he, when the contagious disease was coming upon
him, "I've got something now that I can give to everybody." About
the time when there was considerable grumbling as to the delay in
forwarding to the troops the money due to them, a western paymaster,
in full major's attire, was one day introduced at a public reception.
"Being here, Mr. Lincoln," said he, "I thought I'd call and pay my
respects." "From the complaints of the soldiers," responded the
President, "I guess that's about all any of you do pay." The President
is rather vain of his height, but one day a young man called on him
who was certainly three inches taller than the former; he was like the
mathematical definition of the straight line&mdash;length without breadth.
"Really," said Mr. Lincoln, "I must look up to you; if you ever get in
a deep place you ought to be able to wade out." That reminds us of the
story told of Mr. Lincoln somewhere, when a crowd called him out. He
came out on the balcony with his wife (somewhat below medium height),
and made the following "brief remarks:"&mdash;"Here I am, and here is Mrs.
Lincoln. That's the long and short of it."</p>

<p>One day, when Mr. Bates was remonstrating with Mr. Lincoln against
the appointment of some indifferent lawyer to a place of judicial
importance, the President interposed with, "Come, now, Bates, he's not
half so bad as you think. Besides that, I must tell you, he did me a
good turn long ago. When I took to the law, I was going to court one
morning, with some ten or twelve miles of bad road before me, and I
had no horse. The judge overtook me in his waggon. 'Hello, Lincoln,
are you not going to the court-house? Come in, and I'll give you a
seat.' Well, I got in, and the judge went on reading his papers.
Presently, the waggon struck a stump on one side of the road; then
it hopped off to the other. I looked out, and I saw the driver was
jerking from side to side in his seat; so, says I, 'Judge, I think
your coachman has been taking a little drop too much this morning.'
'Well, I declare, Lincoln,' said he, 'I should not much wonder if
you are right, for he has nearly upset me half a dozen times since
starting.' So, putting his head out of the window, he shouted, 'Why,
you infernal scoundrel, you are drunk!' Upon which, pulling up his
horses, and turning round with great gravity, the coachman said: 'By
gorra! that's the first rightful decision you have given for the last
twelvemonth.'"</p>

<p>A white man not long since sued a black man in one of the courts of
a Free State, and while the trial was before the judge the litigants
came to an amicable settlement, and so the counsel stated to the
court. "A verbal settlement will not answer," replied the judge; "it
must be in writing." "Here is the agreement in black and white,"
responded the counsel, pointing to the parties; "pray what does your
honour want more than this?"</p>

<p>In one of our courts lately a man who was called upon to appear as
a witness could not be found. On the judge asking where he was, an
elderly gentleman rose up, and with much emphasis said, "Your honour,
he's gone." "Gone! gone!" said the judge, "where is he gone?" "That I
cannot inform you," replied the communicative gentleman, "but he is
dead." This is considered the best guarded answer on record.</p>

<p>What odd names some mortals are blessed with! We heard of a family

Stickney, and so on. Three elder children of a family in Vermont were
named Joseph, And, Another; and it is supposed that, should they have
any more, they might have named them Also, Moreover, Nevertheless,
and Notwithstanding. Another family actually named their child Finis,
supposing that it was their last; but they afterwards happened to
have a daughter and two sons, whom they called Addenda, Appendix, and
Supplement. A man in Pennsylvania called his second son James Also,
and the third William Likewise.</p>

<h3><a id="TAKING_THE_STARCH_OUT_217"></a>TAKING THE STARCH OUT.&mdash;217.</h3>

<p>"A capital example," writes a reader, "of what is often termed 'taking
the starch out,' happened recently in a country bank in New England. A
pompous, well-dressed individual entered the bank, and, addressing the
teller, who is something of a wag, inquired: 'Is the cashier in?' 'No,
sir,' was the reply. 'Well, I am dealing in pens&mdash;supplying the New
England banks pretty largely&mdash;and I suppose it will be proper for me
to deal with the cashier.' 'I suppose it will,' said the teller. 'Very
well; I will wait.' The pen-pedlar took a chair, and sat composedly
for a full hour, waiting for the cashier. By that time, he began to
grow uneasy, but sat twisting in his chair for about twenty minutes,
and, seeing no prospect of a change in his circumstances, asked the
teller how soon the cashier would be in. 'Well, I don't know exactly,'
said the waggish teller, 'but I expect him in about eight weeks. He
has just gone to Lake Superior, and told me he thought he should come
back in that time.' Pedlar thought he would not wait. 'Oh, stay if you
wish,' said the teller, very blandly; 'we have no objection to your
sitting here in the day time, and you can probably find some place
in town where they will be glad to keep you of nights.' The pompous
pedlar disappeared without another word."</p>


<h3><a id="THE_EFFECT_OF_ELOQUENCE_218"></a>THE EFFECT OF ELOQUENCE.&mdash;218.</h3>

<p>One of the late Governors of South Carolina was a splendid lawyer, and
could talk a jury out of their seven senses. He was especially noted
for success in criminal cases, almost always clearing his client. He
was once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> counsel for a man accused of horse-stealing. He made a long,
eloquent, and touching speech. The jury retired, but returned in a
few moments, and proclaimed the man not guilty. An old acquaintance
stepped up to the prisoner, and said: "Jem, the danger is passed;
and now, honour bright, didn't you steal that horse?" To which Jem
replied: "Well, Tom, I've all along thought I took the horse; but
since I've heard the Governor's speech, I don't believe I did."</p>

<p>There was a traveller once, down South&mdash;say in the State of
Georgia&mdash;who, halting for the night at an inn, where he was told
that, as there were many guests, he must put up with a shakedown,
was conducted after supper to an outhouse full of cows and pigs.
"Where am I to sleep?" cried the despairing wayfarer. "Spect 'yiccan
please yisself, mas'r," answered with a grin the negro who acted as
chamberlain; "but," he continued, pointing to a corner of the lair,
where there were only two cows and no pigs, "dat's de mose fashionable

<h3><a id="A_PLUMP_QUESTION_220"></a>A PLUMP QUESTION.&mdash;220.</h3>

<p>The late gallant General Sumner, about twenty years ago, was captain
of a company of cavalry, and commanded Fort Atkinson, in Iowa. One of
his men, Billy G&mdash;&mdash;, had received an excellent education, was of a
good family, but an unfortunate habit of mixing too much water with
his whisky had so reduced him in circumstances that out of desperation
he enlisted. Captain Sumner soon discovered his qualifications, and
as he was a good accountant and excellent penman, he made him his
confidential clerk. At times the old habit would overcome Billy's good
resolutions, and a spree would be the result. Captain Sumner, though a
rigid disciplinarian, disliked to punish him severely, and privately
gave him much good advice (after a good sobering in the guard-house),
receiving in return many thanks and promises of amendment; but his
sprees became more and more frequent. One day, after Billy had been on
a bender, the captain determined on giving him a severe reprimand, and
ordered Billy into his presence before he was fully sober. Billy came
with his eyes all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> blood-shot and head hanging down, when the captain
accosted him with: "So, sir, you have been drunk again, and I have
to say that this conduct must cease. You are a man of good family,
good education, ordinarily a good soldier, neat, cleanly, and genteel
in appearance, of good address, and a valuable man; yet you will get
drunk. Now I shall tell you, once for all that&mdash;&mdash;" Here Billy's eyes
sparkled, and he interrupted his superior with: "Beg pardon, captain,
did you say that&mdash;hic&mdash;I was a man of good birth and education?" "Yes,
I did." "And that I was a good soldier?" "Certainly." "That usually
I&mdash;I&mdash;am neat and genteel?" "Yes, Billy." "And that I am a valuable
man?" "Yes; but you will get drunk." Billy drew himself up with great
dignity, and throwing himself on his reserved rights, indignantly
exclaimed: "Well now, Captain Sumner, do you really think Uncle Sam
expects&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to get all the <i>cardinal virtues for twelve dollars a
month</i>?"</p>

<p>I kum to the conclusion lately that life was so onsartin, that the
only way for me to stand a fair chance with other folks was to get my
life insured, and so I called on the agent of the Garden Angel Life
Insurance Company, and answered the following questions, which were
put to me over the top of a pair of specks by a slick little fat old
feller, with a round gray head on him as any man ever owned:&mdash;1. Are
you mail or femail? if so, state how long you have been so. 2. Had
you a father or mother? if so, which? 3. Are you subject to fits? and
if so, du yu have more than one at a time? 4. What iz your precise
fiting wate? 5. Did you ever have any ancestors? and if so, how much?
6. What is your legal opinion of the constitushunality of the ten
commandments? 7. Du yu have any night-mare? 8. Are yu married or
single, or are yu a bachelor? 9. Du yu believe in a future stait? if
yu du, stait it. 10. What are your private sentiments about a rush of
rats to the hed? can it be did successfully? 11. Hav yu ever committed
suicide? and if so, how did it affect yu? After answering the above
questions, like a man in a confirmatiff, the slick little fat old
feller with gold specks on sed I was insured for life, and probably
would remain so for some years. I thanked him, and smiled one ov my
most pensive smiles.</p>


<h3><a id="SHORT_AND_EXPRESSIVE_225"></a>SHORT AND EXPRESSIVE.&mdash;225.</h3>

<p>Some years since there was a great gathering of people at Augusta,
Maine, to take into consideration the subject of building a dam across
the Kennebec River at that point. The meeting was followed by a dinner
at the Mansion House, and the Liquor Law being a thing not yet thought
of, the bottle circulated freely, and many of the guests were getting
"jolly mellow," when Frank &mdash;&mdash;, a wag of an editor, was called on
for a toast. Frank immediately staggered to his feet, and grasping
the back of his chair with one hand, and holding aloft with the
other a tumbler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> of "Old Jamaica," responded somewhat emphatically:
"Gentlemen, d&mdash;n the Kennebec!&mdash;and improve its navigation," and sat
down amid a roar of applause. The dam was built.</p>

<p>An amusing incident says the <i>Selinsgrove</i> (Pa.) <i>Post</i>, occurred in
one of our churches on Sunday, which caused considerable tittering
throughout the congregation. While the minister was in the midst of
his sermon, a little boy about ten years of age quietly left his
seat, took his hat, walked up to the pulpit and asked permission of
the minister to leave the church, saying that he forgot to feed the
pig. The request was granted and the boy left; but returned in a few
minutes, no doubt greatly relieved. It embarrassed the minister for
some minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>An old lady who was making some jam was called upon by a neighbour.
"Sam, you rascal," she said, "you'll be eating my jam when I'm away."
Sam protested he'd die first; but the whites of his eyes rolled
hungrily towards the bubbling crimson. "See here, Sam," said the
old lady, taking up a piece of chalk, "I'll chak your lips, and on
my return I'll know if you've eaten any." So saying, she passed her
forefinger over the thick lip of the darkey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> holding the chalk in the
palm of her hand, and not letting it touch him. When she came back,
she did not need to ask any question, for Sam's lips were chalked a
quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Not far from Central New Jersey lived two young lawyers, Archy Brown
and Thomas Jones. Both were fond of dropping into Mr. Smith's parlour
and spending an hour or two with his only daughter, Mary. One evening,
when Brown and Mary had discussed almost every topic, Brown suddenly,
in his sweetest tones, struck out as follows:&mdash;"Do you think, Mary,
you could leave father and mother, this pleasant home, with all its
ease and comforts, and go to the far West with a young lawyer, who had
but little besides his profession to depend upon, and with him search
out a new home, which it should be your joint duty to beautify, and
make delightful and happy like this?" Dropping her head softly on his
shoulders, she whispered, "I think I could, Archy." "Well," said he,
"there's Tom Jones, who's going West, and wants to get a wife; I'll
mention it to him."</p>

spree the previous evening, arose in the morning and rang the bell
violently. Boots appeared. "Where are my pants? I locked my door
last night, and somebody has stolen them?" Boots was green, and a
little terrified. He left, however, struck with a sudden thought, and
returned with the identical pants. The landlord was called to receive
complaints against Boots; but he made it evident that the man had put
out his pantaloons to be blacked instead of his boots. The lodger left
in the first train.</p>

<p>What guessers printers must be! A New York editor, in descanting upon
the guess-at-half-of-it style of writing in which many articles are
sent to be printed, gives the following amusing specimen. A piece of
poetry before him, written in what, at a reasonable glance, seemed to

a specimen of humanity as one would wish to meet with. After a
severe cross-examination the counsel for the Government paused, and
then putting on a look of severity and ominous shake of the head,
exclaimed, "Mr. Witness, has not an effort been made to induce you to
tell a different story?" "A different story from what I have told,
sir?" "That is what I mean." "Yes, sir; several persons have tried
to get me to tell a different story from what I have told, but they
couldn't." "Now, sir, upon your oath, I wish to know who these persons

'ere for 'arf a crown." "Why the devil didn't you stay at 'ome?" said

get the twopence."</p>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>New York World</i>, in an account of Mr.

some time in shaking hands. This salutation is with him a peculiarity.
It is not the pump-handle 'shake,' nor a twist, nor a spasmodic motion
from side to side, nor yet a reach towards the knee and a squeeze
at arm's length. When Mr. Lincoln performs this rite, it becomes a
solemnity. A ghastly smile overspreads his peculiar countenance; then,
after an instant's pause, he suddenly thrusts his 'flapper' at you,
as a sword is thrust in tierce; you feel your hand enveloped as in a
fleshy vice, a cold clamminess overspreads your unfortunate digits, a
corkscrew burrows its way from your finger nails to your shoulder, the
smile disappears, and you know that you are unshackled. You carefully
count your fingers to see that none of them are missing, or that they
have not become assimilated in a common mass."</p>

are sinners above all among the occupants of street-cars. But read
the following indictment drawn up against the male persuasion of
street-car society, and see if the account is not about balanced.
What "female nuisance" can surpass, for instance, the man who crosses
his legs, or puts his foot upon his knee, allowing a dirty boot to
wipe itself on good clothes passing him; the man who gets in chewing
the stump of a cigar, and declines to throw it away because he is
not smoking, and consequently stenches the whole conveyance; the man
who sits sideways when the seat is crowded; the man who fidgets in
a crowded seat; the man who, in getting out, lifts his feet so high
as to wipe the knees of every passer-by; the man who enters with a
paint pot; the ever-talkative man, who insists on drawing you into
conversation, and boring you with his ideas political; the man who is
deep in his cups; the ill-natured, ugly-looking man, who frightens all
children in arms; the over-dressed man, who is afraid of being mussed;
the rowdy man, who is spoiling for a fight; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> fat man, who occupies
too much room; the lean man, who cuts you with his sharp hones; the
pretty man, who smirks so disgustingly; the man who wants to pick your
pocket; the friendly man, who requests a loan; the man with a writ;
the man that smells of garlic; the man that perfumes with musk; the
vanity man, who displays all the money he has while searching for a
five-cent. postal; the lazy man, who never hurries to get on or off;
the unaccommodating man, who refuses to have his basket placed on the

<h3><a id="EDITORS_EXCHANGING_COMPLIMENTS_254"></a>EDITORS EXCHANGING COMPLIMENTS.&mdash;254.</h3>

<p>The <i>Louisville Journal</i>&mdash;an impudent, one-horse Kentucky concern,
conducted by a walking whisky-bottle&mdash;says that one of our
correspondents deprived it of its maps and despatches from Sherman's
army. The <i>Journal</i> is unable to pay even wages to its correspondents,
and relies upon us for the news. Our correspondent purchased the maps
and intelligence referred to from one of the starving reporters of the
<i>Journal</i>, in order to save him from putting an end to his miserable
existence, since he could live no longer on the bottle of Bourbon a
week with which the <i>Journal</i> supplied him. The Western editors are
all whisky-bottles, their reporters are all whisky, and their papers
have all the fumes of that beverage without any of its strength.
So much for the slanders of the <i>Louisville Journal</i>.&mdash;(<i>New York
Herald.</i>) From the <i>Louisville Journal</i>:&mdash;This paragraph is the one to
which, without having seen it, we referred yesterday in our notice of
W. F. G. Shanks, a war correspondent of the <i>New York Herald</i>. That
paper says that its correspondent purchased from ours the map and the
intelligence referred to; this is the map and the rebel newspapers
mentioned by us yesterday. This is all a base and unmitigated
falsehood. The map was given to the <i>Herald's</i> correspondent upon a
condition which he scandalously violated, and he feloniously broke
the seals of the papers and stole their contents for the use of his
thieving employers. The employers and the <i>employ&eacute;</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> instead of
throwing a stone at us, ought to be pecking the article in the State
prison. It is not supposable that any paper on earth could have aught
to gain from a dispute with the <i>New York Herald</i>. The editor of
that concern is so low down that fifty millstones around his neck,
waist, arms, and legs, couldn't sink him lower. Notoriously, he has
been oftener kicked and horsewhipped than any other man in the United
States. Whoever has had the slightest fancy for horsewhipping or
kicking him has done it. The licence to operate on him in either way,
or both, couldn't have been more perfect if he had worn the word "to
let" in chalk-marks upon his shoulders and coat-tail. When he has
waked up each morning, his reflection has been, "Now, is it to be
a horsewhipping or a kicking to-day?" and occasionally it has been
both, eked out with a smart nose-pulling. In fact, his nose has been
so frequently twisted that it is an entirely one-sided affair, and we
think that in common fairness "the twister" should be sentenced by a
court of justice to "untwist the twist." The editor of the <i>Herald</i>
is said to have a great deal of money, but his kicks far exceed
his coppers. The only time he was ever known to thank God was when
sharp-toed boots and shoes were changed to square-toed. It is said
that by long experience he could always tell, when kicked, whether the
application was made by boots, shoes, brogans, or slippers; at what
particular store the article was bought, what was its cost, what its
quality, and whether it was made of the hide of Durhams, short-horned
Alderneys, Herefords, or Devons. When cattle were killed, it was a
frequent understanding that while the fat was to be tried on the fire
the leather was to be tried on the editor of the <i>Herald</i>. He is
regarded as being undoubtedly the best judge of leather in New York;
not that he is a leather-dealer, but that leather-dealers have had so
much to do with him. He has come so often in contact with leather that
the part of him chiefly concerned has itself become leather; so he not
only walks upon leather when he walks, but sits upon leather when he
sits. The editor of the <i>Herald</i> has lived a good deal longer than he
ought to have done, but it is to be hoped that he can't live always.
And if he ever dies, his hide should be tanned to leather&mdash;that is,
the small portion of it that hasn't already been&mdash;his hair used as
shoemaker's bristles, and his bones made into shoeing-horns.</p>

<h3><a id="A_SLASHING_ARTICLE_255"></a>A SLASHING ARTICLE.&mdash;255.</h3>

<p>Editors, like other shrewd men, must live with their eyes and ears
open. The following story is told of one who started a paper in a
western town. The town was infested by gamblers, whose presence was a
source of annoyance to the citizens, who told the editor that if he
did not come out against them they would not patronize his paper. He
replied that he would give them a "smasher" next day. Sure enough,
his next issue contained the promised "smasher;" and on the following
morning the redoubtable editor, with scissors in hand, was seated in
his sanctum, when in walked a large man, with a horse-whip in his
hand, who demanded to know if the editor was in. "No, sir," was the
reply, "he has stepped out. Take a seat, and read the papers&mdash;he will
return in a minute." Down sat the indignant man of cards, crossed
his legs with his whip between them, and commenced reading a paper.
In the meantime the editor quietly vamoosed downstairs, and at the
landing he met another excited man with a cudgel in his hand, who
asked if the editor was in? "Yes, sir," was the quick response, "you
will find him seated upstairs, reading a newspaper." The latter, on
entering the room, with a furious oath, commenced a violent assault
upon the former, which was resisted with equal ferocity. The fight was
continued till they had both rolled to the foot of the stairs, and had
pounded each other to their heart's content.</p>

gentleman. The loafing guests running immediately to see this wonder,

but all to no avail, for John Whisky had got too strong a hold on him.
Presently, a boy came along who was selling brewers' yeast, which he
carried in a pail. "What's the matter?" queried the hopeful; "can't
you get him up? Well, I can. If this yeast won't raise him, he's a
goner, for it'll raise anything that ever grew." Accordingly, he
poured about half a pint down the man's neck, and, sure enough, to
the surprise of all, it raised him instantly, and he went on his way,

on shore. The Irishman, in his native tongue, expressed his surprise
at the civility of the negro; who, understanding what had been said,
replied in Irish, that he need not be astonished, for that he was
a <i>bit of an Irishman himself</i>. The Irishman, surprised to hear a
black man speak in his <i>Milesian</i> dialect, it entered his mind with
the usual rapidity of Irish fancy, that he really was an Irishman,
but that the climate had changed his fair complexion. "<i>If I may be
so bold, sir</i>," said he, "<i>may I ask how long you have been in this
country</i>?" The negro man, who had only come hither on a voyage, said
he had been in Philadelphia only about four months. Poor Patrick
turned round to his wife and children, and looking as if for the last
time on their rosy cheeks, concluding that in four months they must
also change their complexion, exclaimed, "O merciful powers! Biddy,
did you hear that? He is not more than four months in this country,
and he is already almost as black as jet."</p>

<p>There is an allegorical story current that once, immediately after
Theodore Parker had parted from Ralph Waldo Emerson on the road to
Boston, a crazy Millerite encountered Parker, and cried: "Sir, do
you not know that the world is coming to an end?" Upon which Parker
replied: "My good man, that doesn't concern me; I live in Boston."
The same fanatic, overtaking Emerson, announced in the same terms the
approach of the end of the world, upon which Emerson replied: "I am
glad of it, sir; man will get along much better without it!"</p>


<h3><a id="HOW_TO_GO_MAD_284"></a>HOW TO GO MAD.&mdash;284.</h3>

<p>Be an editor; let the devil be waiting for copy; sit down to write an
article, and get a few sentences done; then let an acquaintance drop
in and begin to tell you stories and gossips of the town; let him
sit, and sit, and sit. This is the quickest way we can think of to go
raving, distracted mad.</p>

<p>A Massachusetts judge has decided that a husband may open his wife's

<p>The editor of the <i>Louisville Journal</i>, in speaking of an assailant
who had vehemently denied a charge of having been drunk on a certain
occasion, says "that he cannot positively state that the gentleman
in question was drunk, but that he does know that he was seen in the
street at midnight, with his hat off, explaining the principles and
theory of true politeness to the toes of his boots!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley, of Concord, Mass., is well known to the naturalists on
account of her valuable collection of lichens, and to the Cambridge
professors on account of her success in training young men for the
university. It is said that a learned gentleman once called to see
this lady, and found her hearing at once the lesson of one student in
Sophocles, and that of another in Differential Calculus, at the same
time rocking her grandchild's cradle with one foot, and shelling peas
for dinner.</p>

<p>One of the substitute soldiers who was presented for examination
at Captain Hamlin's office recently was a man who gave his name as
(we will say) Michael Flynn. When he was stripped, upon his arm was
clearly tattooed the name of John Sullivan. "But, I thought, you said

Hibernian sub, "but I have been married twice." Michael passed.</p>

<p>A Western genius defines a coquette as a box of snuff, from which

wretch, as he may think himself, gets the box&mdash;on the ear.</p>


<h3><a id="QUALIFICATIONS_FOR_A_PARSON_297"></a>QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PARSON.&mdash;297.</h3>

<p>It is related of a certain church in New York, whose deacons and
principal men are of the conservative order, that when recently in
want of a pastor, they made application to a divine noted for his
talents and brilliancy of oratory to become their settled minister.
While negotiating the "call" they signified to the divine that they
did not want a man to preach politics or temperance. "What kind of a
preacher do you want?" inquired the minister. To which they replied
that they desired a pastor who was "<i>rather religiously inclined</i>."
This reminds us of a popular preacher we used to know down East, one
of whose prominent parishioners considered him the perfection of a
preacher, because "he never meddles with either politics or religion!"</p>

went on his way rejoicing.</p>


<h3><a id="AND_THATS_A_FACT_300"></a>&quot;AND THAT'S A FACT.&quot;&mdash;300.</h3>

<p>A paper notorious for its veracity says "that a man in New Hampshire
went out gunning one day this spring; he saw a flock of pigeons
sitting on a branch of an old pine, so he dropped a ball into his gun
and fired. The ball split the branch, which closed up, and caught
the toes of all the birds in it. He saw that he had got them all,
and so he fastened two balls together and fired, cut the branch off,
which fell into the river. He then waded in and brought it on shore.
On counting them there were 300 pigeons, and in his boots were two
barrels of shad."</p>


<h3><a id="A_QUESTION_FOR_ASTRONOMERS_301"></a>A QUESTION FOR ASTRONOMERS.&mdash;301.</h3>

<p>A teacher in a western county in Canada, while making his first
visit to his "constituents," came into conversation with an ancient
"Varmount" lady, who had taken up her residence in the "backwoods."
Of course, the school and former teachers came in for criticism; and
the old lady, in speaking of his predecessor, asked: "Wa'll, master,
what do yer think he larnt the schollards?" "Couldn't say, ma'am.
Pray, what did he teach?" "Wa'al, he told 'em that this 'ere airth
was <i>reound</i>, and went areound; and all that sort 'o thing. Now,
master, what do <i>you</i> think about sich stuff? Don't you think he was
an ignorant feller?" Unwilling to come under the category of the
ignorami, the teacher evasively remarked: "It really did seem strange;
but still there are many learned men who teach these things." "Wa'al,"
says she, "if the airth is reound, and goes reound, what holds it
<i>up</i>?" "Oh, these learned men say that it goes around the sun, and
that the sun holds it up by virtue of the law of attraction." The old
lady lowered her "specs," and, by way of climax, responded:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> "Wa'al,
if these high larn't men sez the sun holds up the airth, <i>I should

<p>A man in New Hampshire had the misfortune recently to lose his wife.

<h3><a id="WHAT_IRISHMEN_DO_303"></a>WHAT IRISHMEN DO!&mdash;303.</h3>

<p>George Penn Johnson, one of our most eloquent stump speakers, who
loves a good thing too well to let it slip upon any occasion,
addressing a meeting where it was a great point to obtain the Irish
vote, after alluding to the native American party in no flattering
terms, inquired, "Who dig our canals? Irishmen. Who build our
railroads? Irishmen. (Great applause.) Who build all our gaols?
Irishmen. (Still greater applause.) Who fill all our gaols? Irishmen!"
This capping climax, if it did not bring down the house, did the Irish
in a rush for the stand. Johnson did not wait to receive them.</p>

<p>One of the American papers observes of Mr. Wentworth, a member of
Congress for a district of Illinois, that "he is so tall, that when
he addresses the people, instead of mounting a stump, as is usual in
the West, they have to dig a hole for him to stand in!" Another paper,
which goes the whole ticket against Mr. Wentworth, politely observes
that they "dig a hole for him not because he is tall, but because he
never feels at home except when he is up to his chin in dirt."</p>

<p>The following peroration to an eloquent harangue, addressed to

sublimity:&mdash;"And now the shades of night had shrouded the earth

disobeyed his mother, and went to the river and got drowned. "Did he
die?" said Bobby, who had given the story due attention. "Yes," was
the serious reply. "What did they do with him?" asked Bobby, after a
moment's reflection. "Carried him home," replied his aunt, with due
solemnity. After turning the matter over in his mind, as it was hoped
profitably, he looked up and closed the conversation by asking, "Why
didn't they chuck him in again."</p>


<h3><a id="THE_MINISTERS_RECEPTION_319"></a>THE MINISTER'S RECEPTION.&mdash;319.</h3>

<p>A certain lady one day had been much annoyed by the ringing of her
door-bell by the mischievous boys in the vicinity, and determined to
be made no more a fool of by going to the door. In the course of the
forenoon, however, her minister called to see her, dressed in his
nicest manner. He ascended the steps, and gently drew the bell-handle,
when the lady shouted from the entry&mdash;"I see you, my boy! if I catch
you I'll wring your neck!" The affrighted gentleman rushed down the

house again.</p>


<h3><a id="PRINTERS_MISTAKES_320"></a>PRINTERS' MISTAKES.&mdash;320.</h3>

<p>During the Mexican war, one newspaper hurriedly announced an important
item of news from Mexico, that General Pillow and thirty-seven of his
men had been lost in a <i>bottle</i>. Some other paper informed the public
not long ago "that a man in a brown surtout was yesterday brought
before the police court, on a charge of having stolen a small <i>ox</i>
from a lady's workbag. The stolen property was found in his waistcoat
pocket." "A <i>rat</i>" says another paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> "descending the river, came
in contact with a steamboat, and so serious was the injury done to
the boat that great exertions were necessary to save it." An English
paper once stated that the Russian General Raekinoffkowsky "was found
dead with a long <i>word</i> in his mouth." It was, perhaps, the same paper
that, in giving a description of a battle between the Poles and the
Russians, said that "the conflict was dreadful, and the enemy was
repulsed with great <i>laughter</i>." Again: "A gentleman was yesterday
brought up to answer the charge of having <i>eaten</i> a stage driver for
demanding more than his fare. At the late Fourth of July dinner, in
the town of Charlestown, none of the poultry were eatable except the

countrymen, and said: "Sir, after much reflection, consideration, and
examination, I have calmly, deliberately, and carefully come to the
determined conclusion, that in cities where the population is very
large there are a greater number of men, women, and children, than in
cities where the population is less. And I firmly believe there is not
a man, woman, or child in all this vast assembly that has reached the
age of fifty or upwards but has felt this mighty truth rolling through
his breast for centuries."</p>

sworn in his examination-in-chief that in his opinion the horse was
sound.&mdash;Counsel: Well, you don't know anything about horses. You're a
parson, you know.&mdash;Witness: I have a good deal of knowledge respecting
horses.&mdash;Counsel: You think you have, I dare say, but we may think
otherwise. I wonder, now, whether you know the difference between a
horse and a cow.&mdash;Witness: Yes, I dare say I do.&mdash;Counsel: Now, then,
tell the jury the difference between a horse and a cow.&mdash;Witness:
Gentlemen, one great difference between these two animals is, that
the one has horns and the other has not; much the same difference,
gentlemen, that exists between a <i>bull</i> and a <i>bully</i> (turning to
counsel). (Roars of laughter, Judge joining.)&mdash;Counsel (very angrily):
I dare say you thought that very funny, sir?&mdash;Witness: Well, I don't
think it was bad, and several of the audience seem to be of the same
opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Startling, terrific, paralyzing.&mdash;<i>Ditchville Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>We understand that the publishers of this extraordinary work, in
consequence of the immense demand, were obliged to issue three
editions at once, and that the united energies of steam and manual
labour in New York, have in vain been employed to satisfy the
incessant applications for it. On various occasions the police have
been called in to protect the booksellers against the insolence of
disappointed customers, while several suits for libel are pending
against persons who, in a paroxysm of rage, have vented their spleen
on the innocent authoress. The excitement has reached a fearful
pitch, and all business has been brought to a stand by the absorbing
devotion of the public to this great work of genius. In some cases
the engineers on the railroads, in perusing it, have been so lost to
a sense of duty, as to let the fires of their locomotives go out,
and cause the stoppage of trains for hours. Porters may be seen
sitting on their wheelbarrows at every corner enjoying its contents.
Omnibus horses are growing fat from the refusal of drivers to ply the
lash, until they have read it through, line by line, to the fearful
catastrophe of the last page, and even the clamorous voice of the
newsboy is no longer heard, for he sits crouching over its fascinating
pages in his cheerless garret. On the first day of the sale, the
doors of the book-stores were strongly barricaded, extra clerks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> were
provided, and yet, despite these precautions, fearful riots took place
among the contending crowd, in which, as the historians say, "neither
age, sex, nor condition were respected." The truth is, that if many
more such books are written in the country, there is great danger
that agriculture, commerce, and manufactures will be abandoned, and
we shall become nothing else than a nation of novel readers.&mdash;<i>The

<h3><a id="THE_ORIGINAL_BROTHER_JONATHAN_345"></a>THE ORIGINAL BROTHER JONATHAN.&mdash;345.</h3>

<p>When General Washington, after being appointed Commander of the Army
of Revolutionary War, came to Massachusetts to organize it, and make
preparations for the defence of the country, he found a great want of
ammunition and other means necessary to meet the powerful foe he had
to contend with, and great difficulty to obtain them. If attacked in
such condition, the cause at once might be hopeless. On one occasion,
at that anxious period, a consultation of the officers and others was
held, when it seemed no way could be devised to make such preparations
as were necessary. His Excellency Jonathan Trumbull, the elder, was
then Governor of the State of Connecticut, on whose judgment and aid
the general placed the greatest reliance, and remarked: "We must
consult 'Brother Jonathan' on the subject." The general did so, and
the governor was successful in supplying many of the wants of the
army. When difficulties arose, and the army was spread over the
country, it became a by-word, "We must consult Brother Jonathan." The
term Yankee is still applied to a portion, but "Brother Jonathan" has
become a designation of the whole country, as John Bull is for England.</p>

discuss the terms of peace. They met accordingly, and, after a talk,
concluded to settle the war by dividing the territory and stopping the
fighting. The North took the Northern States, and the South the Gulf
and sea-board Southern States. Lincoln took Texas and Missouri, and
Davis Kentucky and Tennessee; so that all were parcelled off excepting
Arkansas. Lincoln didn't want it&mdash;Jeff wouldn't have it. Neither would
consent to take it, and on that they split; and the war has been going
on ever since."</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred one day in front of General Turner's
lines. A sergeant stepped out from our rifle-pits, and moved towards
the enemy, waving a late paper, regardless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> of the probability that
he would at any moment be shot. A rebel officer shouted to him to go
back, but the sergeant was unmindful of the warning, and asked, "Won't
you exchange newspapers?" "No," said the rebel, "I have no paper, I
want you to go back." With singular persistence the sergeant continued
to advance, saying, "Well, if you haint a paper, I reckon some of
your men have, and I want to exchange, I tell you." "My men have not
got anything of the kind, and you must go back," said the officer in
a louder tone, and with great emphasis. Nothing daunted, the Yankee
sergeant still advanced, until he stood plumply before the indignant
officer, and said, "I tell ye now you needn't get your dander up. I
don't mean no harm no way. P'raps if ye aint got no newspapers ye
might give me suthin else. Maybe your men would like some coffee
for some tobacco. I'm dreadful anxious for a trade." The astonished
officer could only repeat his command, "Go back, you rascal, or
I'll take you prisoner. I tell you we have nothing to exchange, and
we don't want anything to do with you Yankees." The sergeant said
ruefully, "Well, then, if you haint got nothin', why, here's the paper
any way, and if you get one from Richmond this afternoon you can send
it over. You'll find my name thar on that." The man's impudence or
the officer's eagerness for news made him accept. He took the paper,
and asked the sergeant what was the news from Petersburg. "Oh, our
folks say we can go in there just when we want to, but we are willing
to gobble all you fellows first," was the reply. "Well, I don't know
but what you can do it!" said the lieutenant, turning on his heel and
re-entering his rifle-pits; "meanwhile, my man, you had better go
back." This time the sergeant obeyed the oft-repeated order, and, on
telling his adventure, was the hero of the morning among his comrades.</p>

<p>The hat was passed round in a certain congregation in New York for
the purpose of taking up a collection. After it had made the circuit
of the church it was handed to the minister, who, by the way had
"exchanged pulpits" with the regular preacher, and he found not a cent
in it. He inverted his hat over the pulpit cushion, and shook it, that
its emptiness might be known; then looking towards the ceiling, he
exclaimed, with great fervour, "I thank Heaven that I got back my hat

used a parasol, or even a "kiss-me-quick;" and Adam never complained,
though he wore no clothes, that the sun blistered his skin. It could
not have been wet, or they would have coughed all the time, like
consumptive sheep; and it would have spoiled their garden, let alone
giving them the chilblains and the snuffles. They didn't require
umbrellas, uglies, fans, or india-rubber shoes. There was no such a
thing as a stroke of the sun, or a snow-drift there. The temperature
must have been perfect, and connubial bliss I allot was rael jam up.
The only thing that seemed wanting there was for some one to drop in
to tea now and then, for Eve to have a good chat with, while Adam was
a studyin' astronomy, or tryin' to invent a kettle that would stand
fire; for women do like talking, that's a fact, and there are many
little things they have to say to each other that no man has any right
to hear, and if he did he couldn't understand.&mdash;<i>Sam Slick.</i></p>

<p>THE <i>Steuben Courier</i> says that a man walked forty miles to claim

long marches and the hardships of camp life.&mdash;A man named Jefferson
Davis was drafted in New Bedford on Tuesday last. We hope that he
may be able to go, and be in at the death of his illustrious rebel
namesake.&mdash;Seven of the waiters in one of the popular hotels of Boston
were the victims of the draft, but the next morning after their names
had been drawn from the wheel of the Provost-Marshal, they had all
skedaddled to parts unknown, and have not been heard of since.&mdash;There
were two Mike Sullivans, the <i>Boston Herald</i> says, living at Fort
Hill, and neither had any other distinction. One of them was drafted,
but which of them neither could tell, nor any one else. One of them
was called upon by a friend, who inquired if he was the Michael
Sullivan who had been drafted. "Yes," said Mike, "I suppose I am."
"Are you sure of that, now?" exclaimed Mike's friend. "How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> the
divil do you know but you axe the other Mike Sullivan?"&mdash;A laughable
circumstance took place in the Fourteenth Ward, Philadelphia, during
the drafting. Everything was going on quietly, and good humour
appeared to be depicted upon every countenance. Among the many
hundreds that were there was a pale-faced son of the Emerald Isle,
gazing on the wheel, and at every revolution gasping for breath. Of a
sudden, losing all control of himself, he burst out: "Wherl it round!

orders, all the plums were put into one end of it, and that end placed
next to the captain, who, after helping himself, passed it to the
mate, who never found any plums in his part of it. After this game
had been played for some time, the mate prevailed on the steward
to place the end which had no plums in it next to the captain. The
captain no sooner perceived that the pudding had the wrong end turned
towards him, than picking up the dish, and turning it round, as if
to examine the china, he said: "This dish cost me two shillings in
Liverpool;" and put it down, as if without design, with the plum
end next to himself. "Is it possible?" said the mate, taking up the
dish. "I shouldn't suppose it was worth more than a shilling." And,
as if in perfect innocence, he put down the dish with the plums next
to himself. The captain looked at the mate; the mate looked at the
captain. The captain laughed; the mate laughed. "I tell you what,
young one," said the captain, "you've found me out, so we will just
cut the pudding lengthwise this time, and have the plums fairly
distributed hereafter."</p>

sacrifiss my wife's brother rather'n not see the rebelyin krusht.
And if wuss cums to wuss I'll shed ev'ry drop of blud my able-bodied
relatiens has got to prosekoot the war. I think somebody oughter be
prosekooted, &amp; it may as well be the war as anybody else. My object
in now addressin' you is to give you sum adwice, friend Wales, about
managin' your wife, a bizness I've had over thirty years' experience
in. You had a good weddin. The papers hav a good deal to say about
'vikins' in connection tharewith. Not knowing what that air, and so
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> frankly tells you, my noble lord dook, I can't 'zactly say whether
we had 'em or not. We was both very much flustrated. But I never
enjoyed myself better in my life. Dowtless, your supper was ahead of
our'n. As regards eatin' uses Baldinsville was allers shaky. But you
can git a good meal in New York, and cheap, too. You can git half a
mackrill at Delmonico's or Mr. Mason Dory's, for six dollars, and a
biled pertaters throwd in. I manidge my wife without any particler
trouble. When I fust commenst trainin' her I institooted a series of
experiments, and them as didn't work I abanding'd. You had better do
similer. There's varis ways of managin' a wife, friend Wales, but the
best and only safe way is to let her do jist about as she wants to.
I 'dopted that there plan sum time ago, and it works like a charm.
Remember me kindly to Mrs. Wales. As yehrs roll by, and accidents
begin to happen to you&mdash;and your responsibilities increase&mdash;you will
agree with me that family joys air the only ones a man can bet on
with any certinty of winnin'. It may interest you to know that I'm
prosperin' in a pecoonery pint of view. I make 'bout as much in the
course of a year as a Cab'net offisser does, and I understan' my
bizness a good deal better than sum of 'em do. Respects to St. Gorge
and the Dragon.&mdash;'Ever be happy.'"</p>

<p>Two city merchants conversing upon business at the door of the New

<p>When General Lee was a prisoner at Albany he dined with an Irishman.
Before entering upon the wine, the general remarked to his host, that
after drinking he was apt to abuse Irishmen, for which he hoped the

should be so foolish, and even so wicked, as to go to war and kill
each other; if let alone they would die themselves. And the third, and
last, thing that I wonder at is, that young men should be so unwise
as to go after the young women; if they would stay at home the young
women would come after them.</p>

and, before the operation was performed, had "traded" the boot, which

<h3><a id="HIS_REASONS_FOR_LEAVING_403"></a>HIS REASONS FOR LEAVING.&mdash;403.</h3>

<p>On our trip up the river once we had on board a tall, gaunt-looking
volunteer. His appearance not only indicated that he was lately from
the hospital, but that it would perhaps have been better for him to
have remained there still, for he certainly did not seem to be in a
fit condition to travel. He was from Eastern Ohio, and by some strange
whim of his comrades (soldiers have odd notions as to name), he had
won the cognomen of "Beauregard." He was full of dry humour, and it
had a peculiar zest, coming from such a dilapidated specimen of the
human kind. I asked him: "How long were you in the hospital at &mdash;&mdash;?"
"I stayed just five days; I couldn't stand it any longer." "Why so?
Were you not well treated?" "Well, you see, when I went in there were
six patients. The first day they buried one." "Well, what of that?"
"Nothing&mdash;only the very next day they buried another." "They must have
been severe cases, and made it very unpleasant for you." "Unpleasant!
I knew my turn would come in time. I went in on Monday, and if I
stayed I would be carried out on Saturday. So I made my calculation,
and on Friday I packed my knapsack and went away. If I had not, I'd
surely been buried on Saturday. Six days&mdash;one man each day&mdash;could't
stand that."</p>


<h3><a id="YOUR_FARE_MISS_404"></a>YOUR FARE, MISS.&mdash;404.</h3>

<p>The most veracious chroniclers of Chicago relate the experience of a
young lady from the rural districts of Hoosierdom, who visited the
Queen City of the West, accompanied by her particular swain, and took
an appreciative view of the "elephant." Getting into one of the city
cars for a ride, the maiden took a seat, while the lover planted
himself on the platform. The graceful vehicle had sped but a few
short blocks, when the beneficent young conductor insinuated himself
into the popular chariot, for the purpose of collecting expenses.
Approaching the rustic maiden, he said, affably, "Your fare, miss."
The Hoosier rosebud allowed a delicate pink to manifest itself on
her cheeks, and looked down in soft confusion. The justly popular
conductor was rather astonished at this, and ventured to remark once
more&mdash;"Your fare, miss." This time the pink deepened to carnation,
and the maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> fingered her parasol with pretty coquettishness. The
conductor really didn't know what to make of this sort of thing, and
began to look a little foolish; but as a small boy at the other end
of the car began to show signs of a disposition to leave without
paying for his ride, the official managed to say once more&mdash;"Hem!
miss, your fare." In a moment those lovely violet eyes were looking
up into his face, through an aurora of blushes, and the rosy lips
exclaimed&mdash;"Well, they dew say I am good-looking at hum, but I
don't see why you want to say it out loud!" It was not a peal of
thunder that shook the car just then. Oh, no. It was something that
commenced in a general passengerical titter, and culminating in such
a shattering guffaw as Western lungs alone are capable of. In the
midst of the cachinnatory tempest the "lovyer" came to the rescue of
his Doxiana; and when the "pint of the hull thing" was explained to
him, his mouth expanded to proportions that might have made Barnum's
hippopotamus die of jealousy on the spot. The pair descended from
the car amid a salvo of Mirth's artillery, and when last seen were
purchasing artificial sweetness at a candy-shop.</p>


<h3><a id="AGREEING_WITH_ALL_THE_GIRLS_405"></a>AGREEING WITH ALL THE GIRLS.&mdash;405.</h3>

<p>In a lesson in parsing the sentence, "man, courting capacity of bliss,
etc.," the word courting comes to a pert young miss of fourteen to
parse. She commenced hesitatingly, but got along well enough until
she was to tell what it agreed with. Here she stopped short. But
as the teacher said, "Very well, what does courting agree with?"
Ellen blushed, and hung down her head. "Ellen, don't you know what
that agrees with?" "Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, sir!" "Well, Ellen, why don't you
parse that word? What does it agree with?" Blushing still more, and
stammering, Ellen says, "It a-agrees with <i>all the girls</i>, sir!"</p>


<h3><a id="WHEN_THE_BOAT_STARTED_406"></a>WHEN THE BOAT STARTED.&mdash;406.</h3>

<p>A certain green customer, who was a stranger to mirrors, and who
stepped into the cabin of one of our ocean steamers, stopping in front
of a large pier glass, which he took for a door, said&mdash;"I say, mister,
when does this here boat start?" Getting no reply from the dumb
reflection before him, he again repeated&mdash;"I say, mister, when does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

<p>There is a blind phrenologist in St. Louis who is great on examining
bumps. A wag or two got one of the distinguished judges, who thinks a
great deal of himself, and has a very bald head, which he generally
covers with a wig, to go to his rooms one day, and have his head
examined. Wags and judge arrive. "Mr. B.," said one, "we have now
brought you for examination a head as is a head; we wish to test your
science." "Very well," said the phrenologist, "place the head under
my hand." "He wears a wig," said one. "Can't examine with that on,"
replied the professor. Wig was accordingly taken off, and the bald
head of the highly-expectant judge was placed under manipulation of
the examiner. "What's this? what this?" said the phrenologist; and
pressing his hand on the top of the head, he said, somewhat ruffled,
"Gentlemen, Heaven has visited me with affliction&mdash;I have lost my
eyesight&mdash;but I am no fool; <i>you can't pass this off on me for a
head</i>!"</p>


<h3><a id="CHASING_A_LOCOMOTIVE_408"></a>CHASING A LOCOMOTIVE.&mdash;408.</h3>

<p>A friend who lately indulged in a chase after a locomotive declares it
"the silliest thing a sane man can do." This is his account:&mdash;"Rushing
out from the refreshment-room on the platform, I saw my train moving
off 'gradually,' with about seventy-five yards the start. I have
been counted a good runner in my time, and for the first hundred
yards I gained on it. Then for about a quarter of a mile it was
'nip and tuck,' at the end of which I concluded that steam was more
than a match for muscle, and 'caved.' The last I saw of my train it
was 'going it' around a curve at the rate of twenty-five miles an
hour, the passengers waving their handkerchiefs at me, and cheering
vociferously. As I walked sheepishly back to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, a thought came
into my head that it <i>might</i> run off the track in going round the
curve at that rate of speed, and I am afraid that I rather encouraged
the idea."</p>

<h3><a id="A_GREAT_TRAVELLER_410"></a>A GREAT TRAVELLER.&mdash;410.</h3>

<p>A good story is told of a Washington countryman, who, on his way to
Cincinnati, became somewhat elevated by sundry "drinks," but, as good
luck would have it, found a boat at the wharf, and was quickly on his
way. Soon after leaving the wharf, a man came round for his fare.
Horrall handed him out a five-dollar bill, and received four dollars
and ninety-five cents in change. He rammed it into his pocket-book
with great eagerness, supposing the clerk had made a mistake. That
done, he leaned back into his chair and fell asleep. A little while
and he was plucked awake by the same man, who again demanded fare.
"Discovered the mistake," holding out a handful of change. The man,
as before, took only five cents, and Horrall again went into a doze.
Ere he had got fairly into dreaming of home and friends far away,
around came the collector again, and thus it went on for a long time.
At last Horrall thought it very inconvenient, and concluded to vote
the collector a nuisance, and give him a bit of advice besides; so
he said: "Is (hic) this a da-n-ger (hic) ous (hic) bo-boat?" "By no
means," said the man. "Bran new." "Then, by gummy, (hic) why do (hic)
don't you collect all the fa (hic) hair at once&mdash;not bo-bother a fel
(hic) heller for it every mile as it comes due?" "Really," said the
man, "where do you think you are going?" "Cincin (hic) hinnati," said
Horrall. "Cincinnati," said the polite conductor, "why you must be
sadly out of your reckoning. This is the ferry-boat, and all this
afternoon you have been riding to and fro between New Albany and
Portland."</p>

<p>It chanced one evening, at one of the great hotels, that a gentleman,
seeking in vain for a candle with which to light himself to his room
at a late hour, passed a young lady who had two candles, of which she
politely offered him one. He took it and thanked her, and the next
morning acknowledged the courtesy in the following epigram. Luckily
for the poet (for his epigram would otherwise have been pointless),
the young lady was as handsome as she was polite:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following amusing incident took place upon one of the Ohio river
steamboats:&mdash;While the boat was lying at Cincinnati, just ready to
start for Louisville, a young man came on board, leading a blushing
damsel by the hand, and approaching the polite clerk, in a suppressed
voice; "I say," he exclaimed, "me and my wife have just got married,
and I'm looking for accommodations." "Looking for a berth?" hastily
inquired the clerk&mdash;passing tickets out to another passenger. "A

<h3><a id="HUMAN_NATURE_417"></a>HUMAN NATURE.&mdash;417.</h3>

<p>Some wise man sagely remarked, "there is a good deal of human nature
in man." It crops out occasionally in boys. One of the urchins in the
school-ship <i>Massachusetts</i>, who was quite sick, was visited by a kind
lady. The little fellow was suffering acutely, and his visitor asked
him if she could do anything for him. "Yes," replied the patient,
"read to me." "Will you have a story?" asked the lady. "No," answered
the boy; "read from the Bible; read about Lazarus;" and the lady
complied. The next day the visit was repeated, and again the boy asked
the lady to read. "Shall I read from the Bible?" she inquired. "Oh,
no," was the reply, "I'm better to-day; <i>read me a love story</i>."</p>

<h3><a id="DANIEL_WEBSTER_AND_HIS_BILLS_420"></a>DANIEL WEBSTER AND HIS BILLS.&mdash;420.</h3>

<p>Our readers are aware that the late Hon. Daniel Webster was not so
careful in his pecuniary matters as some men, and this fault was at
times taken advantage of. At one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> time a man sawed a pile of wood
for him, and, having presented his bill, it was promptly paid by
Mr. Webster. The labourer was taken ill during the winter, and a
neighbour advised him to call upon Mr. Webster for the payment of his
bill. "But he has paid me," said the man. "No matter," replied his
dishonest adviser, "call again with it. He don't know, and don't mind
what he pays. It is a very common thing for him to pay much larger
bills twice." The man got well, and carried in his account the second
time. Mr. Webster looked at it, looked at the man, remembered him, but
paid the bill without demurring. The fellow got "short" some three
of four months afterwards, and bethought him of the generosity and
loose manner of Mr. Webster in his money matters, and a third time
he called and presented the bill for sawing the wood. Mr. Webster
took the account, which he immediately recognized, and, scanning the
wood-sawyer a moment, said: "How do you keep your books, sir?" "I keep
no books" said the man, abashed. "I think you do, sir," continued Mr.
Webster, with marked emphasis; "and you excel those who are satisfied
with the double-entry system. You keep your books upon a triple-entry
plan, I observe." Tearing up the account, Mr. Webster added: "Go, sir,
and be honest hereafter. I have no objection to paying these little
bills twice, but I cannot pay them three times. You may retire." The
man left the room, feeling as though he was suffocating for want of
air. He had learned a lesson that lasted through life.</p>


<h3><a id="KEEPING_A_SECRET_421"></a>KEEPING A SECRET.&mdash;421.</h3>

<p>Of the descendants of the Pilgrims there once lived an old man,
who, unlike nearly all his brethren, had no particular respect for
the clergy. Going his accustomed rounds one day, he met a reverend
gentleman, who, after a few casual remarks on worldly topics, thus
addressed him:&mdash;"Mr. Brown, you have lived long; very few attain your
age. Would it not be the part of wisdom to attend to your soul's
concerns immediately? Really, it would rejoice my soul to see you at
the eleventh hour become a praying Christian." "Well, now, Parson
Hoyt, my Bible tells me to pray in secret." "Ah, well&mdash;yes&mdash;but <i>do</i>
you pray in secret?" "Why, now, Parson Hoyt, you know if I should tell
you, 'twouldn't be any secret, anyhow."</p>

<h3><a id="MOST_TOO_SUDDEN_422"></a>MOST TOO SUDDEN.&mdash;422.</h3>

<p>An old lady, a resident of Providence, who had never ridden in the
cars, was persuaded, by the combined efforts of the children, James
and Mary, to accompany them on an excursion, she all the time saying
that she knew something would happen. She took her seat with fear and
trembling, taking hold of the arm of the seat next the passage-way.
The train was late, as excursion trains are usually, and in coming
round a curve the Boston express train was on the same track, both
nearing each other faster than was pleasant. The momentum of each
train was nearly lost, and they came together with a chuck, which
pitched the old lady on her face in the passage-way between the seats.
She rose to her hands, and, looking back, asked: "<i>Jeems, do they
allus stop like that?</i>"</p>


<h3><a id="ANY_RELATIONS_423"></a>"ANY RELATIONS?"&mdash;423.</h3>

<p>The man who collects the names of soldiers for the town records of
Adams was recently the questioner in the following conversation, the
lady of the house replying:&mdash;"Have you any friends in the war, madam?"
"No, sir." "Any relations?" "No, sir." "Do you know anybody from this
neighbourhood who is in the army?" "No, sir." As he was leaving, a
bright thought struck her, and she rushed to the door, exclaiming:
"Oh, my husband has gone to the war!"</p>


<h3><a id="DIDNT_CARE_THEN_IF_HE_DID_424"></a>DIDN'T CARE THEN IF HE DID.&mdash;424.</h3>

<p>A gentleman from Boston chanced to find himself among a little party
of ladies away down East this summer, in the enjoyment of some
innocent social play. He carelessly placed his arm about the slender
waist of as pretty a damsel as Maine can boast of, when she started,
and exclaimed: "Begone, sir; don't insult me!" The gentleman instantly
apologized for his seeming rudeness, and assured the half-offended
fair one that he did not mean to insult her. "No?" she replied,
archly. "Well, if you didn't, you may do it again."</p>


<h3><a id="NO_JUSTICE_IN_THAT_COURT_425"></a>NO JUSTICE IN THAT COURT.&mdash;425.</h3>

before Justice Cole, of Albany, charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> with having brutally
assaulted his wife. The charge was substantiated in the clearest and
most positive manner, and exhibited the most heartless cruelty on the
husband's part. On his examination before the Justice, he had a good
deal to say about "getting justice." "Justice!" exclaimed Squire Cole,
"you can't get it here. This court has no power to hang you!"</p>

young tutor, "in six years you will cease to be Miss L.?" "Why, yes,
sir, I suppose so," said she, very modestly looking at the floor.</p>


<h3><a id="LONGFELLOW_AND_LONGWORTH_428"></a>LONGFELLOW AND LONGWORTH.&mdash;428.</h3>

<p>One of the happiest witticisms on record is related by the Boston

a <i>bon mot</i> made by Longfellow, the poet. Young Mr. Longworth, from

she had the angel taken out, and had a devil engraved at the bottom;
and he drank it off just the same, and she again asked him the reason.
"Why," replied he, "because I won't leave the old devil a drop."</p>

<p>Them that have more than their share of one thing, commonly have less
of another. Where there is great strength, there 'aint apt to be much
gumption. A handsome man, in a gineral way, 'aint much of a man. A
beautiful bird seldom sings. Them that have genius have seldom common
sense. A feller with one idea grows rich, while he who calls him a
fool dies poor. The world is like a baked meat pie; the upper crust is
rich, dry, and puffy; the lower crust is heavy, doughy, and underdone;
the middle is not bad generally, but the smallest part of all is that
which flavours the whole.&mdash;<i>Sam Slick.</i></p>

<p>I took a handful of guano, that elixir of vegetation, and sowed a few
cucumber seeds in it. Well, sir, I was considerable tired when I had
done it, and so I just took a stretch for it under a great pine-tree,
and took a nap. Stranger! as true as I am talking to you this here
blessed minute, when I woke up, I was bound as tight as a sheep going
to market on a butcher's cart, and tied fast to a tree. I thought I
should never get out of that scrape; the cucumber vines had so grown
and twisted round, and wound me and my legs while I was asleep!
Fortunately, one arm was free, so I got out my jack knife, opened it
with my teeth, and cut myself out, and off for Victoria again, hot
foot. When I came into the town, says our captain to me, "Peabody,
what in natur is that ere great yaller thing that's a sticking out of
your pocket?" "Nothin'," sais I, looking as mazed as a puppy nine days
old, when he first opens his eyes, and takes his first stare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> Well, I

<p>It a'n't the feed&mdash;said the young man John&mdash;it's the old woman's looks
when a fellah lays it in too strong. The feed's well enough. After
geese have got tough, 'n' turkeys have got strong, 'n' lamb's got old,
'n' veal's pretty nigh beef, 'n' sparragrass's growin' tall 'n' slim,
'n' scattery about the head, 'n' peas are gettin' so big 'n' hard,
they'd be dangerous if you fired them out of a revolver, we get hold
of all them delicacies of the season. But it's too much like feedin'
on live folks, and devourin' widdah's substance, to lay yourself out
in the eatin' way, when a fellah's as hungry as the chap that said
a turkey was too much for one, 'n' not enough for two. I can't help
lookin' at the old woman. Corned-beef days she's tolerable calm;
roastin'-days she worries some, 'n' keeps a sharp eye on the chap
that carves. But when there's anything in the poultry line, it seems
to hurt her feelin's so to see the knife goin' into the breast, and
joints comin' to pieces, that ther's no comfort in eatin'. When I cut
up an old fowl, and help the boarders, I always feel as if I ought to
say, "Won't you have a slice of widdah?" instead of chicken.&mdash;<i>Oliver

legs, shaft, and head, and no belly; real gander-gutted lookin'

to become a candidate for the Legislature. My politics are short and
sweet, like an old woman's dance. I am in favour of a national bank. I
am in favour of the internal improvement system, and a high protective
tariff. These are my sentiments and political principles. If elected,
I shall be thankful; if not, it will be all the same."</p>

<p>Artemus Ward, in one of his letters, thus gives his idea of
reorganization:&mdash;"I never attempted to reorganize my wife but once.
I shall never attempt it again. I'd bin to a public dinner, and
had allowed myself to be betrayed into drinkin' several people's
health, and wishin' to make 'em as robust as possible, I continued
drinkin' their healths until my own became affected. Consekens was, I
presented myself at Betsy's bedside late at nite, with considerable
licker concealed about my person. I had somehow got perseschum of a
hosswhip on my way home, and rememberin' some cranky observashuns of
Mrs. Ward's in the morin', I snapt the whip putty lively, and in a
very loud voice I said, Betsy&mdash;I continued crackin' the whip over the
bed&mdash;I have come to reorganize you! I dreamed that nite that sumbody
laid a hosswhip over me sev'ril conseckootive times; and when I woke
up I found <i>she</i> had. I haint drunk much of anythin' since, and if I

<p>A young gentleman happening to sit at church in a pew adjoining one

passion, was desirous of entering into a courtship on the spot, but
the place not suiting a formal declaration, the exigency of the case
suggested the following plan:&mdash;He politely handed his fair neighbour
a Bible open, with a pin stuck in the following text:&mdash;Second Epistle
of John, verse fifth&mdash;"And now I beseech thee lady, not as though I
wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
beginning, that we love one another." She returned it pointing to
the second chapter of Ruth, verse tenth&mdash;"Then she fell on her face
and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him 'Why have I found
grace in thine eyes, seeing that I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> stranger?'" He returned the
book, pointing to the thirteenth verse of the Third Epistle of St.
John&mdash;"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
paper and ink, but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face,
that our joy may be full." From the above interview a marriage took
place the ensuing week.</p>

witness. Her husband was present&mdash;a diminutive, meek, forbearing sort
of a man&mdash;who, in the language of Mr. Chapman, "looked like a rooster
just fished out of a swill barrel," while the lady was a large portly
woman, evidently the better horse. As on the former occasion, she
baulked on the cross-examination. The lawyer was pressing a question
urgently, when she said, with vindictive fire flashing from her eyes,
"Mr. Chapman, you needn't think to catch me; you tried that once
before!" Putting on his most quizzical expression, he replied, "Madam,
I haven't the slightest desire to catch you, and your husband looks as
if he was sorry he did." The husband faintly smiled assent.</p>

the shot. "Sir," said Lee, "what do you mean? Do you think you can
dodge the balls? Do you know that Napoleon lost about a hundred

his simple heart, and laying down the scarlet-bound volume in disgust,
he cried to the waiter, "Here, my good man, I shall go back to <i>first

Marshal Kane. "What two characters in scripture remind us of a certain
President in Washington and a certain Marshal in Baltimore?" Give it

Thackeray had joked with him on the American contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> for copyright;

latest peas of summer. I am very fond of peas, and was rejoiced to
see my favourites once again; and I anxiously awaited their arrival.
Miss Tips, Miss Julia Tips, and Tips <i>m&egrave;re</i>, as the French would say,
had each taken a decorous spoonful from the flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> dish, and now

with "Buy Bulwer's last work, sir? Only two shillin'." The gentleman,
willing to have a laugh with the urchin, said: "Why, I am Bulwer,

excited his wonderment at the information he had to impart. Eyeing the
pretended author of "Pelham" with a kind of awe, he approached him

start in the morning, and it so happened that a venerable old "uncle"
of extreme African descent, who was selected to drive them out, missed
his breakfast in the hurry and bustle of departure. This disagreeable
circumstance rendered the old darky very crusty and melancholy during
the entire morning; but at early noon the party adjourned to a country
tavern on the river bank, and had a good dinner, and the old "general"
was not slow to seek some alimentary compensation for the loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> of
his matin meal. It was taken for granted that the old gent's good
humour would be restored by the dinner, but it was soon noticed that
he continued to remain "blue" and sorrowful, and, being surprised
thereat, his master asked him why he was still so cross, since he had
had so good a dinner. The old darky replied: "Yes, massa, me know I'se
had me dinnah, but me habn't had no brekfuss yet, nohow."</p>

<h3><a id="A_NEW_DISH_505"></a>A NEW DISH.&mdash;505.</h3>

<p>Pete Johnson was a tall, green, raw-boned country negro, and knew
nothing of city life or polished society. Recently he became tired
of tilling the soil by the month, journeyed to the metropolis, and
let himself as a waiter on board a steamer which plies up and down
the Sound on the New York, Norwich, and Boston line. As is customary
with new waiters, in order to train them to ease, and give them the
necessary polish and experience, he was required at first to attend
the officers' tables exclusively. But one evening, after a few weeks'
service, there came a great rush of passengers, and, of course, the
supper-room was thronged. Pete was sent to the public tables for the
first time. He got along very well until a guest called for an omelet.
This was a new dish to the green waiter, but he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> he understood
the order correctly, and with his usual gravity, stepped up to the
kitchen door and cried out, "An almanac!"</p>


<h3><a id="THE_LAST_COMPLIMENT_506"></a>THE LAST COMPLIMENT.&mdash;506.</h3>

<p>A story is told of a very polite sheriff and a very polite criminal.
"Sir," said the culprit, as the sheriff was carefully adjusting
the rope, "really your attention deserves my thanks; in fact, I do
not know anybody I should rather have hang me." "Really," said the
sheriff, "you are pleased to be complimentary. I do not know of
another individual it would give me so much pleasure to hang."</p>

<p>Dr. Channing had a brother a physician, and at one time they both

following dialogue ensued:&mdash;"Does Dr. Channing live here?"&mdash;"Yes,
sir." "Can I see him?"&mdash;"I am he." "Who, you?"&mdash;"Yes, sir." "You
must have altered considerably since I heard you preach."&mdash;"Heard me
preach?" "Certainly! you are the Dr. Channing that preaches, ain't
you?"&mdash;"Oh! I see you are mistaken now; 'tis my brother who preaches;
I'm the doctor who practises."</p>


<h3><a id="A_FAIR_RETORT_508"></a>A FAIR RETORT.&mdash;508.</h3>

<p>Mr. Cobden, in one of his speeches, said that he once asked an
enthusiastic American lady why her country could not rest satisfied
with the immense unoccupied territories it already possesses, but
must ever be lusting after the lands of its neighbours. Her somewhat
remarkable reply was, "Oh! the propensity is a very bad one, I admit;
but we came honestly by it, for we inherited it from you."</p>


<h3><a id="DR_FRANKLIN_509"></a>DR. FRANKLIN.&mdash;509.</h3>

<p>The town of Franklin, in Massachusetts, was named in honour of
Benjamin Franklin, the printer philosopher. While in France, a
gentleman in Boston wrote to him of the fact, and added, that as the
town was building a meeting-house, perhaps he would give them a bell.
Franklin wrote the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> characteristic reply, that he presumed that the
good people of F. would prefer sense to sound, and therefore he would
give them a library. This he did, and the library is now in good
condition, and has been of great service to the intelligent people of
that pleasant town.</p>

<h3><a id="DANIEL_WEBSTERS_COURTSHIP_511"></a>DANIEL WEBSTER'S COURTSHIP.&mdash;511.</h3>

<p>The manner of Daniel Webster's engagement to Miss Fletcher is thus
pleasantly described by a letter writer:&mdash;"He was then a young lawyer.
At one of his visits to Miss Grace Fletcher he had, probably with a
view of utility and enjoyment, been holding skeins of silk thread
for her, when suddenly he stopped, saying, 'Grace, we have thus been
engaged in untying knots, let us see if we can tie a knot; one which
will not untie for a lifetime.' He then took a piece of tape, and
after beginning a knot of a peculiar kind gave it her to complete.
This was the ceremony and ratification of their engagement. And now
in the little box marked by him with the words 'precious documents,'
containing the letters of his early courtship, this unique memorial is
still to be found&mdash;the knot never untied."</p>

<p>An ingenious down-easter, who has invented a new kind of "love-letter
ink," which he has been selling as a safeguard against all actions
for breach of promise of marriage, in so much as it entirely fades
from the paper in two months after date, was recently "done brown" by
a brother down-easter, who purchased a hundred boxes of the article,
and gave him his note for 90 days. At the expiration of the time, the
ink inventor called for payment, but, on unfolding the scrip, found
nothing but a blank piece of paper. The note had been written with his
own ink.</p>


<h3><a id="A_ROUGH_BEDFELLOW_518"></a>A ROUGH BEDFELLOW.&mdash;518.</h3>

<p>A man in Arkansas had been drinking until a late hour at night, and
then started for home in a state of sweet obliviousness. Upon reaching
his own premises he was too far gone to discover any door to the
domicile he was wont to inhabit, and, therefore, laid himself down in
a shed which was a favourite rendezvous for swine. They happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
be out when the new comer arrived, but soon returned to their bed. The
weather being rather cold, they, in the utmost kindness, and with the
truest hospitality, gave their biped companion the middle of the bed,
some lying on either side of him, and others acting the part of quilt.
Their warmth prevented him from being injured by exposure. Towards
morning he awoke. Finding himself comfortable, in blissful ignorance
of his whereabouts, he supposed himself enjoying the accommodation of
a tavern, in company with other gentlemen. He reached out his hand,
and catching hold of the stiff bristles of an old hog, exclaimed:
"Hallo, my good friend, you've got a deuce of a beard! When did you
shave last?"</p>

<p>An American secretary of state had two afflictions&mdash;an obliging

latter called, and the former was too polite to shut him out. The
secretary, when he could stand the nuisance no longer, said to the
doorkeeper: "Do you know what that man comes after?" "Yes," replied
the functionary, "an office, I suppose." "True, but do you know what
office?" "No." "Well, then, I'll tell you; he wants your office." The
bore was admitted no more.</p>

and accidentally&mdash;(men's arms, awkward things, are ever in the
way!)&mdash;dropped an arm round her waist. No objection was made for a
while, and the arm gradually relieved the side of the carriage of the
pressure upon it. But of a sudden, whether from a late recognition of
the impropriety of the thing, or the sight of another beau coming,
never was known, the lady started with volcanic energy, and with a
flashing eye exclaimed: "Mr. B., I can support myself!"&mdash;"Capital,"
was the instant reply, "you are just the girl I have been looking for

<p>"Bob," now called Belmont Bob, is the body servant of General
Clernard, and at the battle of Belmont it is said of him that when
the retreat commenced he started for the boats. Reaching the banks,
he dismounted, and slid rapidly down, when an officer, seeing the
action, called out: "Stop, you rascal, and bring along the horse."
Merely looking up as he waded to the plank through the mud, the darky
replied: "Can't 'bey, colonel; major told me to save the most valuable

<h3><a id="GENERAL_GRANT_552"></a>GENERAL GRANT.&mdash;552.</h3>

<p>When the North American General Grant was about twelve years old, his
father sent him a few miles into the country to buy a horse from a man
named Ralston. The old man told his son to offer Ralston 50 dollars
at first; if he wouldn't take that, to offer 55 dollars, and to go as
high as 60 dollars, if no less would make the purchase. The embryotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
major-general started off with these instructions fully impressed
upon his mind. He called upon Mr. Ralston, and told him he wished to
buy the horse. "How much did your father tell you to give for him?"
was the very natural inquiry from the owner of the steed. "Why," said
young Grant, "he told me to offer you 50 dollars, and if that wouldn't
do to give you 55 dollars, and if you wouldn't take less than 60
dollars to give you that." Of course, 60 dollars was the lowest figure
at which the horse could be parted with.</p>

<p>During one of the battles on the Mississippi, between General Grant's

a Capt. Duncan, in his usual pompous, solemn manner: "Captain Duncan,
fire! the crisis has come." Duncan, without saying a word, turned to
his men, who were standing by their guns already shotted and primed,
and simply called out, "Fire!" The men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> slightly surprised at
the order, there being no particular object within range, when an old
grey-headed Irish sergeant stepped up with "Plaze, yer honour, what

<h3><a id="AN_AMERICAN_HELP_558"></a>AN AMERICAN "HELP."&mdash;558.</h3>

<p>The following amusing description of an American servant we extract
from a letter from New York:&mdash;An American "help" is no menial. She is
spoken of, not satirically, but in simple good faith, as "the young
lady" who "picks up" the house and "fixes" the dinner-table. Before
she agrees to enter a family she cross-examines her mistress as to
whether the house is provided with Hecker's flour, and Berbe's range;
brass pails; oil-cloth on the stairs; and hot and cold water laid on.
Then she states the domestic "platform" on which she is prepared to
act. "Monday I bakes; and nobody speaks to me. Tuesday I washes; I'se
to be let alone. Wednesday I irons; you'd best let me be that day.
Thursday I picks up the house; I'm awful ugly that day in temper, but
affectionate. Friday I bakes again. Saturday my beau comes. And Sunday
I has to myself." The "help," I repeat, is a young lady. She attends
lectures, and may some day become a member of a Woman's Rights'
Convention; and it is because she is a young lady, and the persons
who require her assistance do not choose to run the risk of being
driven raving mad by her perversity and her impertinence, that so many
married couples in the United States never venture on housekeeping for
themselves, but live from year's end to year's end in uproarious and
comfortless hotels.</p>

General. "Why," answered the soldier, "I have not seen my wife for
over three months." "Three months!" remarked General Thomas, "why,
I haven't seen my wife for over three years!" "Well, that may be,"
rejoined the other, "but you see, General, me and my wife ain't of

Well, you're kinder glad to leave it, I guess? Are you a widow?"

<p>One of the last stories of Yankee inquisitiveness makes the victim
give his tormentor a direct cut, in telling him he wished to be asked
no further questions. The inquisitor fell back a moment to take
breath, and change his tactics. The half-suppressed smile on the
faces of the other passengers soon aroused him to further exertions;
and, summoning up more resolution, he then began again. "Stranger,
perhaps you are not aware how mighty hard it is for a Yankee to
control his curiosity. You'll please excuse me, but I really would
like to know your name and residence, and the business you follow.
I expect you ain't ashamed of either of 'em, so now won't you just
obleedge me?" This appeal brought out the traveller, who, rising up
to the extremest height allowed by the coach, and throwing back his
shoulders, replied: "My name is General Andrew Washington. I reside in
the State of Mississipi. I am a gentleman of leisure, and, I am glad
to be able to say, of extensive means. I have heard much of New York,
and I am on my way to see it; and, if I like it as well as I am led to
expect, <i>I intend to&mdash;buy it</i>." Then was heard a shout of stentorian
laughter throughout the stage-coach, and this was the last of that
conversation.</p>

nose too lobular, blunt, and bottle-like; his expression altogether

through which he protruded himself about half way, and, stretching
out his arm, committed the theft. Mr. Obfusticate Brief addressed the
jury. "What an outrage (looking horrified, and with outstretched and
trembling arms)! I repeat, what an outrage upon your common sense it
is for the State's Attorney to ask at your hands the conviction of my
client on such testimony! The law is against <i>entering</i> a house, and

is <i>in</i>, and the other half <i>out</i>?" The jury brought in a verdict of
"guilty," as to one-half of his body, from his waist up, and "not

With these, he says, they killed on an average 27 head of buffaloes

following cross question:&mdash;"How did you kill all these buffaloes with
only one bullet?" "Listen, and I'll explain," said the hunter. "We
shot a buffalo; I stood on one side, and my brother on the other.
Brother fired; the ball passed into the barrel of my rifle. The next
time, I fired, and brother caught my ball in his rifle. We kept up the
hunt for twelve months, killing nearly 200 buffaloes per week, and yet
brought home the same ball we started with."</p>

<p>Governor Powell, of Kentucky, was once a great favourite. He never

qualities were remarkable. His great forte lay in establishing a
personal intimacy with every one he met, and in this he was powerful
in electioneering. He chewed immense quantities of tobacco, but never
carried the weed himself, and was always begging it from every one
he met. His residence was in Henderson, and in coming up the Ohio,
past that place, I overheard the following characteristic anecdote
of Lazarus:&mdash;A citizen of Henderson coming on board, fell into
conversation with a passenger, who made some inquiries about Powell.
"Lives in your place, I believe, don't he?"&mdash;"Yes; one of our oldest
citizens." "Very sociable man, ain't he?"&mdash;"Remarkably so." "Well, I
thought so. I think he is one of the most sociable men I ever met in

<p>At the Sutter House, Sacramento, a New Yorker, newly arrived, was
lamenting his condition, and his folly in leaving an abundance at
home, and especially two beautiful daughters, who were just budding
into womanhood, when he asked the other if he had a family. "Yes,
Sir, I have a wife and six children in New York, and I never saw one
of them." After this reply, the couple sat a few minutes in silence,
and then the interrogator again commenced. "Were you ever blind,
Sir?"&mdash;"No, Sir." "Did you marry a widow, Sir?"&mdash;"No, Sir." Another
lapse of silence. "Did I understand you to say, Sir, that you had a
wife and six children living in New York, and had never seen one of
them?"&mdash;"Yes, Sir, I so stated it." Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> and a longer pause of

<p>It is said the Southerns captured at Mansfield two waggons loaded
with paper collars, and that General Dick Taylor returned the collars
through a flag of truce, with a letter to General Banks, in which the
facetious rebel said:&mdash;"I have boiled, baked, and stewed these things,
and can do nothing with them. We cannot eat them. They are a luxury
for which we have no use, and I would like, therefore, to exchange
them for a like quantity of hard tack." The joke is a good one, and
has convulsed the Western boys, who have no great admiration for the
"Liberator of Louisiana." When the Western troops passed General
Banks's head-quarters, coming into Alexandria, they groaned, jeered,
and called aloud, "How about those paper collars?"</p>

<p>Old Rowe kept a hotel in the northern part of York State, which
he boasted was the best in those parts; where, as he used to say,
you could get anything that was ever made to eat. One day in came
a Yankee. He sent his horse round to the stable, and stepping up
to the bar, asked old Rowe what he could give him for dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
"Anything, Sir," said old Rowe; "anything from a pickled elephant
to a canary-bird's tongue." "Wal," says the Yankee, eyeing Rowe, "I
guess I'll take a piece of pickled elephant." Out bustles Howe into
the dining-room, leaving our Yankee friend nonplussed at his gravity.
Presently he comes back again. "Well, we've got 'em; got 'em all
ready, right here in the house; but you'll have to take a whole 'un,
'cause we never cut 'em." The Yankee thought he would take some cod
fish and potatoes.</p>

<h3><a id="MORE_COPY_615"></a>MORE COPY.&mdash;615.</h3>

<p>Once in autumn, wet and dreary, sat this writer, weak and weary,
pondering over a memorandum book of items used before&mdash;book of
scrawling head notes, rather; items taking days to gather them in hot
and sultry weather, using up much time and leather, pondered we those
times o'er. While we conned them, slowly rocking (through our mind
queer ideas flocking) came a quick and nervous knocking&mdash;knocking at
our sanctum door. "Sure, that must be Jinks," we muttered&mdash;"Jinks
that's knocking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> our door; Jinks, the everlasting bore." Ah, well
do we remind us, in the walls which then confined us, the "exchanges,"
lay behind us, and before us, and around us, all scattered o'er the
floor. Thought we, "Jinks wants to borrow some papers till to-morrow,
and 'twill be relief from sorrow to get rid of Jinks the bore, by
opening wide the door." Still the visitor kept knocking&mdash;knocking
louder than before. And the scattered piles of papers, cut some rather
curious capers, being lifted by the breezes coming through another
door; and we wished (the wish was evil, for one deemed always civil)
that Jinks was to the d&mdash;&mdash;l, to stay there evermore; there to find
his level&mdash;Jinks the nerve-unstringing bore. Bracing up our patience
firmer, then, without another murmur, "Mr. Jinks," said we, "your
pardon, your forgiveness we implore. But the fact is, we were reading
of some curious proceeding, and thus it was, unheeding your loud
knocking there before." Here we opened wide the door. But phancy now
our pheelins&mdash;for it wasn't Jinks the bore&mdash;Jinks, nameless, evermore!
But the form that stood before us, caused a trembling to come o'er
us, and memory quickly bore us back again to days of yore&mdash;days when
items were in plenty, and where'er this writer went he picked up
interesting items by the score. 'Twas the form of our "devil," in an
attitude uncivil; and he thrust his head within the open door, with
"The foreman's <i>out o' copy</i>, sir&mdash;he says he wants some more!" Yes,
like Alexander, wanted "more." Now this "local" had already walked
about till nearly dead&mdash;he had sauntered through the city till his
feet were very sore&mdash;and walked through the street called Market, and
the byways running off into the portions of the city, both public
and obscure; had examined store and cellar, and had questioned every
"feller" whom he met from door to door, if anything was stirring&mdash;any
accident occurring&mdash;not published heretofore&mdash;and he had met with
no success; he would rather guess he felt a little wicked at that
ugly little bore, with the message from the foreman that he wanted
"something more." "Now, it's time you were departing, you scamp!"
cried we, upstarting. "Get you back into your office&mdash;office where you
were before&mdash;or the words that you have spoken will get your bones all
broken;" (and we seized a cudgel, oaken&mdash;that was lying on the floor);
"take your hands out of your pockets, and leave the sanctum door; tell
the foreman there's no copy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> you ugly little bore." Quoth the devil,
"send him more." And our devil, never sitting, still is flitting,
still is flitting, back and forth upon the landing, just outside the
sanctum door. Tears adown his cheeks are streaming&mdash;strange light from
his eye is beaming&mdash;and his voice is heard, still crying, "Sir, the
foreman wants some more." And our soul pierced with the screaming, is
awakened from its dreaming, and has lost the peaceful feeling; for
the fancy will come o'er us, that each reader's face before us, hears
the horrid words&mdash;"We want a little more!"&mdash;Words on their foreheads
glaring, "Your 'funny' column needs a little more!"</p>

<h3><a id="WHO_FIDDLED_620"></a>WHO FIDDLED.&mdash;620.</h3>

<p>In the Pennsylvania Legislature, two years ago, there was a member
named Charlie Wilson, from one of the Northern frontier counties,
who considered himself among the great orators of the day, and, when
pretty well filled with "Harrisburg water," would get off for the
edification of his colleagues some very rich illustrations. Being
somewhat interested in a bill before the House, he made what he
considered one of his master-speeches, during the delivery of which he
used the illustration of "Nero fiddling while Rome was burning." He
had scarcely taken his seat when a member tapped him on the shoulder,
and said: "Say, Charlie, it wasn't Nero that 'fiddled,' it was C&aelig;sar.
You should correct that before it goes on the record." In an instant
he was upon his feet, and exclaimed. "Mr. Speaker&mdash;Mr. Speaker&mdash;I
made a mistake. It wasn't Nero that 'fiddled' while Rome was burning;
it was <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>." Happily for him, the Speaker was so busily
engaged that he did not hear him; but some members near heard and
enjoyed the joke. Afterwards some one told him that he was right in
the first place, which resulted in his reading all the ancient history
in the State Library during the remainder of the winter, to assure
himself as to who it was that "fiddled."</p>

<p>There is a curious duel now pending in Boston which began ten years
ago. Mr. A., a bachelor, challenged Mr. B., a married man, with one
child, who replied that the conditions were not equal&mdash;that he must
necessarily put more at risk with his life than the other, and he
declined. A year afterwards he received a challenge from Mr. A.,
who stated that he too had now a wife and child, and he supposed,
therefore, the objection of Mr. B. was no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> valid. Mr. B.
replied that he now had two children, consequently the inequality
still subsisted. The next year Mr. A. renewed the challenge, having
now two children also; but his adversary had three. The matter when

<h3><a id="COLONEL_CROCKETT_AND_THE_COON_633"></a>COLONEL CROCKETT AND THE 'COON.&mdash;633.</h3>

<p>I discovered a long time ago that a 'coon couldn't stand my grin. I
could bring one tumbling down from the highest tree. I never wasted
powder and lead when I wanted one of the creatures. Well, as I was
walking out one night, a few hundred yards from my house, looking
carelessly about me, I saw a 'coon planted upon one of the highest
limbs of an old tree. The night was very moony and clear, and old
Ratler was with me; but Ratler won't bark at a 'coon&mdash;he's a queer
dog in that way. So I thought I'd bring the lark down in the usual
way, <i>by a grin</i>. I set myself&mdash;and, after grinning at the 'coon a
reasonable time, found that he didn't come down. I wondered what was
the reason, and I took another steady grin at him. Still he was there.
It made me a little mad. So I felt round, and got an old limb about
five feet long, and planting one end upon the ground, I placed my chin
upon the other, and took a rest. I then grinned my best for about five
minutes, but the cursed 'coon hung on. So, finding I could not bring
him down by grinning, I determined to have him, for I thought he must
be a droll chap. I went over to the house, got my axe, returned to the
tree, saw the 'coon still there, and began to cut away. Down it come,
and I run forward; but d&mdash;&mdash;n the 'coon was there to be seen. I found
that what I had taken for one was a large knot upon a branch of the
tree, and, upon looking at it closely, I saw that <i>I had grinned all
the bark off, and left the knot perfectly smooth</i>.</p>

three were tilted into the river. The Indiana man, as he rose puffing
and blowing above water, caught hold of the tail of the colt, not
having a doubt that the natural instinct of the animal would take
him ashore. The old mare took a direct line for the shore; but the
frightened colt swam lustily down the current with the owner. "Let
go the colt and hang on the old mare," shouted some of his friends.
"Pooh, pooh!" exclaimed the Indiana man, spouting the water from his

week since we recorded the death of one who was an old father in the
church, a careful reader of the <i>Index</i>, and who paid for three papers
in advance."</p>


<h3><a id="AN_INFANT_TEACHER_666"></a>AN INFANT TEACHER.&mdash;666.</h3>

<p>Under the title of "An Odd Advertisement," a New York paper publishes
the following:&mdash;"A young lady, perfectly competent, wishes to form
a class of young mothers and nurses, to instruct them in the art of
talking to infants in such a manner as will interest and please them."</p>

<h3><a id="QUADRUPLICATED_PUN_667"></a>QUADRUPLICATED PUN.&mdash;667.</h3>

<p>A comedian at Boston, by way of puff for his approaching benefit,
published the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Dear Public, you and I of late<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Have dealt so much in fun;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll crack you now a monstrous great<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Quadruplicated pun!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Like a <i>grate full</i> of coals I'll glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A <i>great full</i> house to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And if I am not <i>grateful</i>, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A <i>great fool</i> I must be!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<h3><a id="BUCOLIC_STUPIDITY_668"></a>BUCOLIC STUPIDITY.&mdash;668.</h3>

<p>We saw a venerable looking cow yesterday, says the <i>Cincinnati
Herald</i>, eating pine sawdust, under the impression that it was bran.
She didn't find out her mistake until night, when it was found that
she gave turpentine instead of milk.</p>


<h3><a id="LIFE_IN_KENTUCKY_669"></a>LIFE IN KENTUCKY.&mdash;669.</h3>

<p>The following story of "Life in Kentucky" being in print ought, of
course to be believed:&mdash;"Early one morning the shouts and cries of a
female were heard. All ran to the spot. When they arrived they saw a
man and a bear engaged in combat. They had it hip and thigh, up and
down, over and under, the man's wife standing by and hallooing 'fair
play.' The company ran up and insisted on parting them. 'No, no,' said
the woman, 'let them fight it out; for it's the first fight I ever saw
that I didn't care which whipped!'"</p>


<h3><a id="AMERICAN_PROVERBS_AND_SIMILES_670"></a>AMERICAN PROVERBS AND SIMILES.&mdash;670.</h3>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ambition</span> is as hollow as the soul of an echo.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Tide</span>, steamboats, and soda-water will wait for no
one.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Big</span> feet, like a leather shirt, are more for use
than ornament.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Money</span> slips from the fingers like a water-melon
seed, travels without legs, and flies without wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">It</span> is the lot of humanity to err at times, as
the drunken man said when he mistook the pig-pen for his
bedroom.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A good</span> deed will stick out, with an inclination to
spread, like the tail of a peacock.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">You</span> might as well undertake to whistle a
grape-vine from a white oak, as to induce a girl to
relinquish her lover.</p>


<h3><a id="SIMILES_671"></a>SIMILES.&mdash;671.</h3>

<p>
<span class="smcap">As</span> big as all out of doors.<br />

<span class="smcap">As</span> slick as greased lightning.<br />

<span class="smcap">As</span> crazy as a bed-bug.<br />
<span class="smcap">As</span> mad as all wrath.<br />
<span class="smcap">As</span> wrathy as a militia officer on a training-day.<br />
<span class="smcap">As</span> proud as a tame turkey.<br />
<span class="smcap">As</span> melancholy as a Quaker meeting-house by moonlight.<br />
<span class="smcap">As</span> useless as whistling psalms to a dead horse.<br />
<span class="smcap">Like</span> all nature.<br />
<span class="smcap">Like</span> all fury.<br />
<span class="smcap">Like</span> all possessed.<br />

<p><big>MR. HOWARD</big>, Surgeon Dentist, 52, Fleet Street, has
introduced an entirely new description of ARTIFICIAL
TEETH, fixed without springs, wires, or ligatures. They
so perfectly resemble the natural teeth as not to be
distinguished from the originals by the closest observer.
They will never change colour or decay, and will be found
superior to any teeth ever before used. This method does
not require the extraction of roots, or any painful
operation, will support and preserve teeth that are loose,
and is guaranteed to restore articulation and mastication.
Decayed teeth stopped, and rendered sound and useful in
mastication.</p>

<p>VICE-CHANCELLOR WOOD stated that Dr. J. Collis Browne was
undoubtedly the Inventor of Chlorodyne. Eminent hospital Physicians
of London stated that Dr. J. Collis Browne was the discoverer of
Chlorodyne; that they prescribe it largely, and mean no other than
Dr. Browne's.&mdash;See <i>Times</i>, July 13, 1864. The public, therefore,
are cautioned against using any other than Dr. J. COLLIS BROWNE'S
CHLORODYNE.</p>

<p>THIS INVALUABLE REMEDY produces quiet, refreshing sleep, relieves
pain, calms the system, restores the deranged functions, and
stimulates healthy action of the secretions of the body.</p>

<p>"After prescribing Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne, for
the last three years, in severe cases of Neuralgia and Tic

its valuable effects. Really in some cases it acted as a

for this report, I must come forward and state my candid
opinion that it is a most valuable medicine."</p>

<p>"I can confidently state that Chlorodyne is an admirable
Sedative and Anti-Spasmodic, having used it in Neuralgia,
Hysteria, Asthma, and Consumption, with remarkably
favourable results. It relieved a fit of Asthma in four

most distressing manner, no previous remedy having had so
immediate and beneficial an effect."</p>

Notes on Joe Miller From <i>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i>:<br /><br />

Joe Miller (Joseph or Josias) (1684-August 15, 1738) was an English
actor, who first appeared in the cast of Sir Robert Howard's Committee
at Drury Lane in 1709 as Teague. Trinculo in The Tempest, the First
Grave-digger in Hamlet and Marplot in Susanna Centlivre's The
Busybody, were among his many favourite parts. He is said to have been
a friend of Hogarth.<br /><br />

He frequented the "Black Jack" tavern on Portsmouth Street in London,
which was a favourite of the Drury Lane players and those from
Lincoln's Inn Fields. Allegedly he was very serious in the bar and
this led to an in-joke whereby all his companions ascribed all new
jokes to him.<br /><br />

After Miller's death, John Mottley (1692-1750) brought out a book
called Joe Miller's Jests, or the Wit's Vade-Mecum (1739), published
under the pseudonym of Elijah Jenkins Esq. at the price of one
shilling. This was a collection of contemporary and ancient coarse
witticisms, only three of which are told of Miller. This first edition
was a thin pamphlet of 247 numbered jokes. This ran to three editions
in its first year.<br /><br />

Owing to the quality of the jokes in Mottley's book, their number
increasing with each of the many subsequent editions, any time-worn
jest came to be called "a Joe Miller", a Joe-Millerism, or simply a
Millerism.<br /><br />
